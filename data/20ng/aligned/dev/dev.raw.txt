It was no criticism of Islam for a change, it was a criticism of the
arguments used. Namely, whenever people you identify as Muslims are
the victims of the attacks of others, they are used an argument for
the bad situation of Muslims. But whenever deeds by Muslim that victimize
others are named, they do not count as an argument because what these
people did was not done as a true Muslims. No mention is made how Muslims
are the cause of a bad situation of another party.
 
Double standards.

I pondered it for all of ten seconds when I realised that since
we don't have any reliable statistics for sexual promiscuity,
and since the whole issue of "depression" isn't at all well 
defined for earlier centuries, you are probably talking crap.

Of course, you could pull a Mozumder on us, and say that people
who are having sex outside marriage are *defined* to be depressed.

I can't say I'd ever noticed, myself.

I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world
if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population. 
It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways, I know, but my newsreader is
down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit, so I figure I might as
well post something new myself.

Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a
higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The
typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the
same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the
other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn
somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,
than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it
expresses its own selfishness.

I assume that you are talking about the appeals processes, etc.?
Well, it should be noted that people who are imprisoned for life
will also tend to appeal (though not quite as much in the "final
hours."

Anyway, economics is not a very good reason to either favor or oppose

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not
the result of the natural process of evolution (but rather an "act of God")
and then in the same post say that these other processes (volcanos et al.)
are natural occurrences.  Who gave YOU the right to choose what things are
natural processes and what are direct acts of God?  How do you know that
God doesn't cause each and every natural disaster with a specific purpose
in mind?  It would certainly go along with the sadistic nature I've seen in
the bible.

Adam & Eve (TWO PEOPLE), even tho they had the honor (or so you christians
claim) of being the first two, definitely do NOT represent a majority in
the billions and trillions (probably more) of people that have come after
them.  Perhaps they were the majority then, but *I* (and YOU) weren't
around to vote, and perhaps we might have voted differently about what to
do with that tree.  But your god never asked us.  He just assumes that if
you have two bad people then they ALL must be bad.  Hmm.  Sounds like the
same kind of false generalization that I see many of the theists posting
here resorting to.  So THAT's where they get it... shoulda known.

The poster casually trashed two thousand years of Jewish history, and

That's right.   There have been.    There have also been people who
were formally Nazis.   But the Nazi party would have gone nowhere
without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the
street who behaved as though casual anti-semitism was perfectly
acceptable.

I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa
against Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally
insulting. 

I think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long
posting, and to say

	seems you are implying....."

is at the very best quite disingenuous, and perhaps even
dishonest.    If anyone care to dig back and read the full

I trust you don't deny that Islamic teaching has "something
to do" with the fatwa against Rushdie?

So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of

which are not all self-determined?

Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending
Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize
you.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using "petty sarcasm".  So
B.M. can have his "temporary atheists" whenever he needs them and all the
"temporary atheists" can later say that they were always good Muslims because
they never explicitly rejected Islam.  

Temporary atheism, temporary Islam, temporary marriage.  None of it sticks.

then, what would you expect from a bunch of people who can't even agree on

For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an
epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of
knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical
basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?
 
There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence
of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses
word "on faith", we just mean that having found this person to be
reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.
If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about
gods?
 
The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then
one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,
rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith
is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable
basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at
other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable
knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than
theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other
knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than
Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?
 
I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't
require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that
there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and
simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until
contrary evidence is found.

Yes I fully agree with that, but is it "I don't believe gods exist", or
"I believe no gods exist"? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)
pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word "believe" to mean.

Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak
atheism, at least according to the FAQ:

# Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.
# Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is
# often referred to as the "weak atheist" position, and the latter as "strong
# atheism".
# 
# It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  "Weak
# atheism" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  "Strong
# atheism" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not
# fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are "strong atheists".

(From mathew's "An Introduction to Atheism" version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93)

Should the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of "belief"?
Can it?

No it in the way it is usually used. In my view, you are saying here that
driving a car requires faith that the car drives.
 
For me it is a conclusion, and I have no more faith in it than I have in the

No, that's a word game. The term god is used in a different way usually.
When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is
commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and
that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.
 
Interestingly, there are those who say that "existence exists" is one of
the indubitable statements possible.
 
Further, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is
already used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying
more with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far
are incomplete, making it a fallacy.

Where does that follow? Aren't observations based on the assumption

Apparently not.

In response to his claim that it "terrifies" gay people not to be able
to "indoctrinate children to our lifestyle" (or words to that effect),
I sent Roger a very calm, carefully-written, detailed letter
explaining simply why the BSA policy does, indeed terrify me.  I did
not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an
answer.  Thus far, I have not received an answer.  I can conclude only
that Roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not
worth defending.

In fact, that's exactly the point: people can control their behavior.
Because of that fact, there is no need for a blanket ban on
homosexuals.

In this era of AIDS, isn't someone's fucking *everyone's* interest?  (semi
:-))

I propose "We have no motto."

Recently in the glorious state of Maryland (the only state whose state song
refers to Abraham Lincoln as a tyrant), people have gotten all wound up over
the state motto (which we inherited from the Calverts):

    "Fatti Maschii, Parole Femine"

which, if you read Italian, says,

    "Manly deeds, womanly words"

or something to that effect.  In the state which not so long ago had four
women out of seven representatives, this represents a problem.  The official
solution was to change the translation, so now it means:

    "Strong deeds, gentle words"

My personal suggestion was changing it to "walk softly and carry a big
stick."

I will object to definitions as reality.  If you then amend it to

I could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout
back in the 1960s. The issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the
same. Thanks for a well put testimonial. Stan Krieger and his kind who
think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. The BSA has
been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
haven't given up. Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
scouting is still worth fighting for.

On a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this
camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing
it. Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo.

Consider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. One

Here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything
or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not
telling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments
against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an
alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably
call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize
of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,
and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you

Actually, the story goes that Lucifer refused to bow before MAN as 
God commanded him to.  Lucifer was devoted to God.

Oh yeah, there is nothing in Genesis that says the snake was anything
more than a snake (well, a talking one...had legs at the time, too).

I don't think pointing out contradictions in STORIES is the best way
to show the error in theology:  if they think a supernatural entity
kicked the first humans out of paradise because they bit into a
fruit that gave them special powers...well, they might not respond
well to reason and logic.  :^)

Are you making a meta-argument here?  In any case, you are wrong.

Wrong.  That was exactly the issue.  Go back and read the context

Now that I've done you the kindness of responding to your questions,

But, the goal need not be a subjective one.  For instance, the goal of
natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  It wasn't
really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions
to this were necessary.  Intelligent animals have different needs than
the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more
complicated than "the law of the jungle."  I don't think that
self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  And, by
objectivity, I am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be
carried out completely.

No, the argument says John has known Q, ie a codified version of the logia,
and not the original, assuming that there has been one. It has weaknesses,
of course, like that John might have known the original, yet rather referred
to Q in his text, or that the logia were given in a codified version in
the first place.
 
The argument alone does not allow a firm conclusion, but it fits well into
the dating usually given for the gospels.

Not necessarily, Luke may have trusted the version he knew better than the
version given by Matthew. Improving on Matthew would give a motive, for
instance.
 
As far as I know, the theory that Luke has known Matthew is based on a
statistical analysis of the texts.

Yes, but an if gives only possibilities and no evidence. The authencity of

well.

Jim,

I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at
least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of
the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to
validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,
then virtually nothing is known of the first century.

You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it
speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection
has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of
atheism.

This file contains responses to articles which occur repeatedly in
alt.atheism.  Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the
"Introduction to Atheism"; you are advised to read that article as well
before posting.

These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of
the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If
you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't
covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: What is the purpose of this newsgroup?

Typical posting:

Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups?  
What is there to discuss?

Response:

Many things are discussed here, including:

* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's
  family
* Prayer in schools
* Discrimination against atheists
* Sunday trading laws
* The Satanic Child Abuse myth
* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'
* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students
* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers
* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual
* Why people become atheists

Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians
looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't 
want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure 
from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.

------------------------------

Subject: Hitler was an atheist!

Typical posting:

Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!

Response:

Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:

   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in
   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_
   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_
   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]

   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their
   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the
   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be
   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every
   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who
   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his
   religious community and tries to butt into the other.

   [...]

   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will
   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_
   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]

          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.

Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief
wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed 
to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, 
though.

------------------------------

Subject: The Bible proves it

Typical posting:

In the Bible it says that...

Response:

Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable
accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were
recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed
'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The
Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being
accepted.

Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is
subject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and
one thing only is not legitimate.

Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.

It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other
equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.

------------------------------

Subject: Pascal's Wager

Typical posting:

If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --
but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to
hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.

Response:

This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.

Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are
many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often
described as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is a
follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.

Secondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to be
incorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in
the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.
Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in
favour of prayer.

Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that 
the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of 
comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God 
is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the
argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.

Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on 
evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or 
cost-benefit analysis.

Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:

  1. One does not know whether God exists.
  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does
     exist.
  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.
  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.

There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an
assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in
the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is
considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no
information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information
can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates
information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at
no "cost".

The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The
problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the
Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The
argument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your interests
to believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal
intended the argument to be viewed.

The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is
omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as
a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all
whether people believe in him.

Subject: What is Occam's Razor?

Typical posting:

People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?

Response:

William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's 
Razor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities 
unnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposing
the existence of some entity, then do so.

Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it 
more generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".

The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations 
for what we see around us:

1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which
came into being as a result of natural processes.

2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and 
there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be 
of non-zero complexity.

Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest 
that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.
Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:

3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  
We just imagine that there is.

This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people 
find unacceptable.

Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus

Typical posting:

I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.

Response:

Preaching is not appreciated.

Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that
are on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and
will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup
talk.religion.misc).

You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite
newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would
have them do unto you!

Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy
analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the
basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell
atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,
since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.

------------------------------

Subject: Why I know that God exists

Typical posting:

I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.

Response:

Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship
exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not
exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.

Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many
people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been
abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.

------------------------------

Subject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"

Typical posting:

Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?

Response:

Einstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". 
This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the
Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's
refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,
Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.

A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:
"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of
what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of
human beings."

Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an
objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random
events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that
QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for
statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,
and much evidence suggests that it never will be.

A longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A
Symposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion
in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In
it he says:

  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events
   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side
   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him
   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an
   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a
   personal God interfering with natural events could never be
   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this
   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific
   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.

   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives
   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine
   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,
   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm
   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers
   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal
   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past
   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they
   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable
   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity
   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably
   more worthy task..."

Einstein has also said:

  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,
   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a
   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.
   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the
   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our
   science can reveal it."

The latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen 
Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  
Also from the same book:

  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics
   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind 
   it."

Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does 
not in itself imply that Christianity is false.

Subject: Everyone worships something

Typical posting:

Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.

Response:

If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about
those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for
example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.

------------------------------

Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause

Typical posting:

Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so
chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.

Response:

The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has
no smallest member.

Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does
not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and
especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by
any particular religion.

------------------------------

Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed

Typical posting:

The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you
don't think all this appeared here just by chance?

Response:

This is known as the Argument From Design.

It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the
universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living
creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the
newsgroup talk.origins for a while.

There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.
However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of
so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,
observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the
universe and life on earth.

The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of
something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that
surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some 
external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos
deliberately.

But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind
capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must
be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the
existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist
position.

This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,
what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling 
improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not
created and just "is" (or "was").

From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe
just "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book
"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closed
and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.

The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called 
Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on
the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it
evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the 
watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the 
universe too must have a creator.

The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above 
those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates 
watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have 
created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are 
clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.

Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in 
the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear 
reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument 
would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a 
different part of creation.

Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that 
the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore 
stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the 
argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not 
random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus 
internally inconsistent.

Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true

Typical posting:

The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary
evidence.  For example...

Response:

The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary
evidence.

Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or
James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many
scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but
that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" of
the original text have been published to this effect.

Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320
C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate
falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the
first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is
generally given the title of authorship for this material.

Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is
more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently
Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.

------------------------------

Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

Typical posting:

Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the
Bible to be both true and complete.

Response:

Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal 
system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary 
arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be 
valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically
speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision
procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal 
system.)

Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar 
Paradox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This 
sentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal 
system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.

The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims
that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to
prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.

One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the
existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. 
This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.

It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms
that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show
that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that
would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists
within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about
whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.

Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about
the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.

Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates
that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be
both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal
systems, so such claims are nonsense.

Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism

Typical posting:

Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?

Response:

The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.
Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman
is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of
the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce
federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the
presidential primary:

 RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?"

 GB: "I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in
      God is important to me."

 RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of
      Americans who are atheists?"

 GB: "No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,
      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under
      God."

 RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation
      of state and church?"

 GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not
      very high on atheists."

UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were
still angry over the remarks.

The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,
1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,
Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.

On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,
cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a
lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School
District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"
(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:
 
 RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.
      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"
 
 EM: "It's bullshit."
 
 RS: "What is bullshit?"
 
 EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."
 
 RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush
      campaign is on this issue."

 EM: "You're welcome."

After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract
his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the
President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by
his original statement, and wrote:

  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports
   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or
   supported by the government."

Subject: I know where hell is!

Typical posting:

I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!

Response:

There are several towns called "Hell" in various countries around the
world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly
amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now 
getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.

Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted

Typical posting:

Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?

Response:
 
American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical
contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for
details.

There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the
archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.

Subject: The USA is a Christian nation

Typical posting:

Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the
United States be considered a Christian nation?

Response:

Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear
that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some
quotes; there are many more.

  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?
   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the
   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen
   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been
   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert
   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient
   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,
   needs them not."
      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785

  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of
   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.
   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"
      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson

  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people
   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of
   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will
   always avail themselves for their own purpose."

      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813

  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or
   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely
   above it."

      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",
        Nov. 20, 1728

------------------------------

Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation

Typical posting:

Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any
sense founded upon the Christian religion?

Response:

No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty
of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):

   Article 11

   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense
   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of
   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as
   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility
   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no
   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption
   of the harmony existing between the two countries.

The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections
such as Charles Bevans' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of the
United States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).

The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on
June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was
recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the
quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.

The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul
General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of
Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there
is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.

In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the
quotation.

                       Constructing a Logical Argument

Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument
found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to
logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.

Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise
OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether
it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to
study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic
knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an
argument.

Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally
applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely
explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is
the right tool for the job.

Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A
proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, "It is
raining" or "Today is Tuesday".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to
be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning
of "deny", not the everyday meaning.

The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular
arrangement of words used to express it.  So "God exists" and "There exists a
God" both express the same proposition.

An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of
statements to establish a definite proposition".  An argument consists of
three stages.

First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to
continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They
are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. 

Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as "because",
"since", "obviously" and so on.  (The phrase "obviously" is often viewed with
suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious
premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to
question it.  You can always say "Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious" when
you've heard the explanation.)

Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known
as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of
one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of
valid inference.

The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further
inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as "implies that" or
"therefore".

Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which
is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often
indicated by phrases such as "therefore", "it follows that", "we conclude"
and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.

For example:

Every event has a cause (premise)
The universe has a beginning (premise)
All beginnings involve an event (premise)
This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)
Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)

Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another
argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with
respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.

Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,
the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated 
afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if 
sometimes a little confusing.

Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or
conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever
producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some
statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:

"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,
 or the Son of God."

This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert
the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its 
conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll
come to those later.)

Another example:

"God created you; therefore do your duty to God."

The phrase "do your duty to God" is not a proposition, since it is neither
true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an
argument.

Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form "A because
B".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the
statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then
it is not an argument, it is an explanation.

For example:

"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not
 start." -- This is an argument.

"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."
 -- This is an explanation.

There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A
deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions
-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must
also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid
argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the
conclusion is true.

An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the
truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;
however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other
arguments, and about how probable their premises are.

There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive
nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive
arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.

It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does
not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly 
counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more
carefully.

Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an
argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. 
For example:

   All insects have wings (premise)
   Woodlice are insects (premise)
   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)

Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. 
If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. 
The argument is thus entirely valid.

More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,
as in:

   All fish live in the sea (premise)
   Dolphins are fish (premise)
   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)

However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid
inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a "truth table" for
implication.

The symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion. 
"T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.

Premise Conclusion Inference
   A        B        A=>B
----------------------------
   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference
   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.

   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion
                             false, the inference must be invalid.

   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,
                             the conclusion must be true.

A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound 
argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse
valid arguments with sound arguments.

To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require
lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably
more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing
an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.

In everyday English the term "fallacy" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs
as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair
enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of
technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or
convincing.

So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical
argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect
when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being
misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be
exhaustive.

ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)

The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the
threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It
is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right". 
The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.

For example:
"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who
refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."

ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM

Argumentum ad hominem is literally "argument directed at the man".

The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying
to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or
people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an
assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.

For example:
"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers."

Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by 
showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of
reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not
argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's
testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the
Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).

The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person
argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of
the opponent's particular circumstances.

For example:
"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue
otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?"

This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing
the opponent's argument.

This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For 
example:

"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. 
You're white."

This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's
adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is
also known as "poisoning the well".

ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM

Argumentum ad ignorantium means "argument from ignorance".  This fallacy
occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it
has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that
something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this
is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved
true, a basic scientific principle.)

Examples:
"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise."

"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has
shown any proof that they are real."

Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is
generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.

Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce
certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can 
validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:

"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water
to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,
even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no
such flood occurred."

In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has
not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,
however.

ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM

This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is 
committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a 
conclusion accepted.  For example:

"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me
guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan."

ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM

This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To
commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by
appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often
characterized by emotive language.  For example:

"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women."

"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying
to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"

ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM

This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of
asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more
likely it is that that proposition is correct.

ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM

The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win
support for an assertion.  For example:

"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."

This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference
to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a
discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly
between:

"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"
and
"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent
 computer"

Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black
hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable 
whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.

THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT

The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a
particular case whose "accidental" circumstances mean that the rule is
inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the
specific.  For example:

"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must
dislike atheists."

This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide
every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.

CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION

This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one
forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not
representative of all possible cases.

For example:
"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are
insincere."

SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER

A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a
particular situation in which the features of that particular situation
render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a
hasty generalization.

NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

These are known as False Cause fallacies.

The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the
cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For 
example:

"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God
cured me of the headache."

The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to
be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For 
example:

"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid
atheism for the same reasons."

CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC

This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that
because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves
no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.

PETITIO PRINCIPII

This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the
conclusion reached.

CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO

This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one
wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the
fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:

"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any
government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. 
Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open
to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government
office."

Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the 
conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason
for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. 
Another example is the classic:

"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the
Bible is true because it is the word of God."

COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION

This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded 
question:

"Have you stopped beating your wife?"

The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not
even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,
when they ask questions like:

"Where did you hide the money you stole?"

Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:

"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"
or
"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"

IGNORATIO ELENCHI

The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument 
supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do
with that conclusion.

For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the
teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length
that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he
argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.

Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse
emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more
favourable light.

EQUIVOCATION

Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different
meanings in the same argument.  For example:

"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it
remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a
license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."

AMPHIBOLY

Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because
of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.

ACCENT

Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,
the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are
emphasized.  For example, consider:

"We should not speak ILL of our friends"
and
"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"

FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION

One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts
of something must apply to the whole.  For example:

"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very 
lightweight."

The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number
of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:

"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars
are less environmentally damaging than buses."

FALLACY OF DIVISION

The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like
its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a
property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:

"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich."

The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by
each item.  For example:

"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."

THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT

This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful
events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the
first event.

For example:
"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin
and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot
legalize marijuana."

"A IS BASED ON B" FALLACIES / "IS A TYPE OF" FALLACIES

These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way
similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.

Examples:
"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of
history?"

"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a
form of Christianity?"

"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of
animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?"

AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A
is true".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for
implication given earlier.

DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT

This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B
is false".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is
a fallacy.

Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has
the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false", where A does NOT in
fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is
invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce
anything about B.

CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL

This fallacy is an argument of the form "If A then B, therefore if B then A".

ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM

This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply
because it is old, or because "that's the way it's always been."

ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM

This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of
asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer
than something else.

ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM

The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those
with more money are more likely to be right.

ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM

The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or
more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the
argumentum ad crumenam.

ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM

This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the
more often it is heard.  An "argumentum ad nauseum" is one that employs
constant repetition in asserting something.

BIFURCATION

Also referred to as the "black and white" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when
one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other
alternatives exist or can exist.

PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS

This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex
question.

NON SEQUITUR

A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises
which are not logically connected with it.

RED HERRING

This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue
being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the
points being made, towards a different conclusion.

REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION

Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.

SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF

The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or
proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad
ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who
denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is
the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.

STRAW MAN

The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it
can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,
then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a
fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been
made.

THE EXTENDED ANALOGY

The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general
rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two 
different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a 
claim that those situations are analogous to each other.

This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about 
anti-cryptography legislation:

"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."

"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported
 Martin Luther King."

"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the
 struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!"

TU QUOQUE

This is the famous "you too" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to
be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:

"You're just being randomly abusive."
"So?  You've been abusive too."

Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups.

Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post
them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has
been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the
alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles:

   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers
   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism
   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument
   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources

This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The
others are entirely optional.

If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled "A Primer on How to Work With
the Usenet Community", "Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet"
and "Hints on writing style for Usenet" are particularly relevant.  Questions
concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

These articles are free.  Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them
to anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the
author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it
does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating
around the network.


                                Finding Stuff

All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are
some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:

1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with
   "Alt.Atheism FAQ:".

2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.

   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up
   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
   problem.

3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].
   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest
   versions of the FAQ files there.

   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you
   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to
   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with

      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq

   in the body.

4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article
   "Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these
   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.

5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
   consisting of the following lines:

      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources
      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq
      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction
      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic
      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources

5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of
   the following lines:

      send atheism/faq/faq.txt
      send atheism/faq/logic.txt
      send atheism/faq/intro.txt
      send atheism/faq/resource.txt

   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.
   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and
   "send atheism/index".

6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the
   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this
   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to
   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.
   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,
   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have 
   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.

 This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the 
 belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist.
 This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are
 conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have
 to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe
 in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at
 God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan
 except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond
 hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The 
 reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians
 have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.

>Fine, but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of

 How did they shoot themselves in the foot?

  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a 
  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and
  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least
  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this
  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because
  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the
  russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict
  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant
  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists
  can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).

>though it's less arrogant and pompous.

 Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist
 doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may
 just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:
 
 Strong atheism - "I believe god does not exist"   a positive belief

 Weak atheism   - "I don't believe in a god"       a negative belief
 
 these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of
 god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that
 you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)
 
 suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent
 as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas
 exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person
 not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that
 even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:
 
 christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god
 
 atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)
 
 atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set
 
 agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)

 Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not
  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always 
  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival
  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.

So, let's see. If some guy writes a piece with a title that implies

This supports nothing. I have no reason to believe that this is 
piece is anything other than another anti-Islamic slander job.
I have no respect for titles, only for real content. I can look
up this article if I want, true. But I can tell you BCCI was _not_
an Islamic bank. Seeing as I'm spending my time responding to
propaganda (in responding to this little sub-thread) I really
don't feel a deep need to do more than make statements to the
effect that the propaganda is false. If someone wants to discuss
the issue more seriously then I'd be glad to have a real discussion,
providing references, etc.

You're right.  And David Koresh claimed to be a Christian.

Anyone who dies for a "cause" runs the risk of dying for a lie.  As for
people being able to tell if he was a liar, well, we've had grifters and
charlatans since the beginning of civilization.  If David Copperfield had
been the Messiah, I bet he could have found plenty of believers.  
Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer, and he wasn't the
first to be "witnessed."  What sets him apart?

Rubbish.  Nations have followed crazies, liars, psychopaths, and 
megalomaniacs throughout history.  Hitler, Tojo, Mussolini, Khomeini,
Qadaffi, Stalin, Papa Doc, and Nixon come to mind...all from this century.
Koresh is a non-issue.

Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course.  There are flaws in your
logic everywhere.  And as I'm sure others will tell you, read the FAQ!

Of course, you have to believe the Bible first.  Just because something is
written in the Bible does not mean it is true, and the age of that tome plus
the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible.  So if you
do quote from the Bible in the future, try to back up that quote with 
supporting evidence.  Otherwise, you will get flamed mercilessly.

Just like weight lifting or guitar playing, eh?  I don't know how you 
define the world "total," but I would imagine a "total sacrafice [sp]
of everything for God's sake" would involve more than a time commitment.

You are correct about our tendency to "box everything into time units."
Would you explain HOW one should involove God in sports and (hehehe)
television?

I'm sure zero-intested economical systems survive on a small-scale,
co-ops is not an Islamic invention, and we have co-operatives working
all around the world. However such systems don't stand the corruption
of a large scale operation. Actually, nothing could handle human
greed, IMHO. Not even Allah :-).

Seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic

message.

Sigh, it seems religion makes your mind/brain filter out anything
that does not fit into your personal scheme. 

So anyone that thinks the possibilities with Jesus is bound to the
classical Lewis notion of 'liar, lunatic or saint' is indeed bound
to become a Christian.

And that, of course, is the point.   You can't simply divide the
world into atheists and non-atheists on the basis of god-belief.

If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity, and
have nothing to say about behaviour, then belief in a supernatural
being is your criterion.

But once you start talking about behaviour, then someone's suscept-
ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you 
are - I assume - worried about.

And in that area, what you care about is whether someone is sceptical,
critical and autonomous on the one hand, or gullible, excitable and
easily led on the other.

I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
that a person is easily led.   Whether they have a worship or belief 
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
beside the point.

I agree fully with the above statement and is *precisely* what I meant
by my previous statements about Islam not being anarchist and the
law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable. 


>Hence, on such clarification from the ulama [Islamic scholars], Muslims

I disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the 
Islamic law to all muslims, wherever they may be. The above conclusion 
does not strictly follow from the foregoing, but only the conclusion 
that the fatwa cannot be *enforced* according to Islamic law. However, 
I do agree that the punishment cannot be applied to Rushdie even *were*
it well founded.

Certainly putting a price on the head of Rushdie in Britain is a criminal

I would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 Imams with you, although
my preference would be to move the discussion to another
newsgroup.  I feel a philosophy
or religion group would be more appropriate. The topic is deeply
embedded in the world view of Islam and the
esoteric teachings of the Prophet (S.A.). Heresy does not enter
into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric
religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical
substance of man's being and nature.

A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory
books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's "Fundamental's
of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe" - Mizan Press,
translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book
(if you can find a decent translation) is "Wilaya - The Station
of the Master" by the same author. I think it also goes under the
title of "Master and Mastership" - It's a very small book - really
just a transcription of a lecture by the author.
The introduction to the beautiful "Psalms of Islam" - translated
by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of
Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We
have these books in our University library - I imagine any well
stocked University library will have them.

From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You
should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable 
Shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the
charge of heresy is levelled.

And you know why this is? Because you've conveniently _defined_ a theist as

atheists. The above statement is circular (not to mention bigoting), and,
as such, has no value.

How do we come up with this setup?  Is this subjective, if enough people agreed
we could switch the order?  Isn't this defining one unknown thing by another? 
That is, good is that which is better than bad, and bad is that which is worse
than good?  Circular?

Well, I've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you

mating practices, etc.  I don't think that these few cases are enough to
disprove the general trend of natural morality.  And, again, the mating

Indeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems
are not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural
system is a subset of the objective ones.

I don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn't harmful, although
it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that
homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean "bisexuality?"

Of course, if you're planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring one's
leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's
other plans.


In Rushdie's case, the one under discussion, one can. It is tragic that
in _some_ "Islamic" countries this is so. There are, however, Islamic
countries (whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is
to be incorporated), e.g. Kuwait, where one can freely make such
statements without fear.

This story has become tiresome. The conditions are clear. If you care to
make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made
public statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of _TSV_. If
he did make such statements then he should have made _that_ clear rather
than trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal
feelings.

The majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps.
There seems quite alot of incentive for the British to have control
of NI, like using the North Channel and Irish Sea as a waste dump (I was
appalled at the dumping I saw in the harbor in Belfast). It is my
understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water --
it'd be quite a problem if NI got its independence from Britain and

If one is a vegan (a vegetarian taht eats no animal products at at i.e eggs, 
milk, cheese, etc., after about 3 years of a vegan diet, you need to start 
taking B12 supplements because b12 is found only in animals.) Acutally our 
bodies make B12, I think, but our bodies use up our own B12 after 2 or 3 
years.  
Lacto-oveo vegetarians, like myself, still get B12 through milk products 
and eggs, so we don't need supplements.
And If anyone knows more, PLEASE post it.  I'm nearly contridicting myself

So, only intelligent beings can be moral, even if the bahavior of other

Animals of the same species could kill each other arbitarily, but they
don't.  Are you trying to say that this isn't an act of morality because
most animals aren't intelligent enough to think like we do?

If you were omniscient, you'd know who exactly did what, and with what
purpose in mind.  Then, with a particular goal in mind, you sould be
able to methodically judge whether or not this action was in accordance
with the general goal.

In an objective system, there are known goals.  Then, actions are judged
as either being compatible with these goals, or not.  Simple.  The problem
with most systems in current practice is that the goals differ.  That is,
the goals of each society are different.

Note that an objective system is not necessarily an inherent one.

But, we can enslave the animals, right?  But just not kill them?  Or
are you a vegetarian for health reasons?

>So, are you a vegetarian?

No.  I fail to see how my *personal* views are relevant, anyway.

>Is it wrong to eat animals in your personal moral system?

Of course not.  It seems perfectly valid to kill members of other species
for food.  It might be nice, though, if the other animals were not made
to suffer.  For instance, a cow in a field lives out its life just about
the same way it would in the wild.  They seem happy enough.  However,
the veal youngsters aren't treated very well.

>How about an "objective" moral system?

I don't know.  What is the goal of this particular system?  There is no
inherent system.

>How about a "natural" moral system.

Nope.  Again, it seems okay to kill other species for food.

My point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe.  Saying 
that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and 
counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups.  I see in your posts a 
spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don'
t believe exactly as you do.  If you're here to try to convert the atheists 
here, you're failing miserably.  Who wants to be in position of constantly 
defending themselves agaist insulting attacks, like you seem to like to do?!
I'm sorry you're so blind that you didn't get the messgae in the quote, 
everyone else has seemed to.

Well, we can.   What would you like to know about my particular moral

If you raise a topic I've never considered, I'll be quite happy to 
invent a moral belief out of thin air.

But now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way,
and I don't think you've even noticed.

In another part of this thread, you've been telling us that the
"goal" of a natural morality is what animals do to survive.

But suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long
term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some 
other species, either terrestrial or alien.

Does that make it moral to do so?

Worse?  Maybe not, but it is definately a violation of the

Pardon me?   *I* am trying to apply human terms to non-humans?

I think there must be some confusion here.   I'm the guy who is
saying that if animal behaviour is instinctive then it does *not*
have any moral sugnificance.   How does refusing to apply human
terms to animals get turned into applying human terms?

Ah, the law of "silly" and "less silly".   what Mr Livesey finds

silly".

Now that's a devastating argument, isn't it.

The quotation marks should enclose "laws," not "must."

If there were no such rules, even instinctive ones or unwritten ones,
etc., then surely some sort of random chance would lead a chimp society
into chaos.

Sigh.   I wonder how many times we have been round this loop.

I think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.
I am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as
primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem
to exhibit self-awareness.

I have never been to Wisconsin, though I have been to
neighbor Minnesota. Being a child of the Middle Atlantic (NY, NJ, PA)
I found that there were few states in the provences that stood
out in this youngster's mind: California, Texas, and Florida to 
name the most obvious three.  However, both Minnesota and Wisconsin
stuck out, solely on the basis of their politics.  Both have 
always translated to extremely liberal and progressive states.
And my recent trip to Minnestoa last summer served to support that
state's reputation.  My guess is that Wisconsin is probably the
same.  At least that was the impression the people of Minnesota left
with me about their neighbors.

The only question in my head about Wisconsin, though, is 
whether or not there is a cause-effect relationship between
cheese and serial killers :)

You should have tried one of the soc.culture groups in the Middle East
or South Asia area (they are a little more open than the Islam channel).  
I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the 
world created itself (or something like that) so each particle is a God 
which created the other Gods.  The soc.culture.african is also nice for 
some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion.  Especially 
when Sudan is mentioned.

Every time somone writes something and says it is merely describing the norm,
it is infact re-inforcing that norm upon those programmed not to think for
themselves. The motto is dangerous in itself, it tells the world that every
*true* American is god-fearing, and puts down those who do not fear gods. It
doesn't need anyone to make it dangerous, it does a good job itself by just
existing on your currency.

Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US 
has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada 
from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion 
of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  
Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess 
we "invaded" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have 
invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles 
for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from 
Spain.

So if you mean by the word "invaded" some sort of military action where
we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally
"invaded" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.
(If some nation "invades" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be
invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of
view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).

No, it's someone who believes in "peace-at-all-costs".  In other words,
a person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and
Czechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one
who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.

"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik," you ask?  Well, it depends
on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over
freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's "bad" to be a peace-nik.

The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be "bad" and "unconscionable".  I would not have any
argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with 
the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank
hypocrisy!)  All to stop we "warmongers" who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense.

Time to get off the soapbox now.  :)

#Am I making a wrong assumption for the basis of morals?  Where do they come

It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily
very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what
is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little
over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different
thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),
but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating
meat may be perfectly legal.

No.  Often the answer is "we are".  But if society is those who make
the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should
make the rules, that's yet another.  I don't claim to have the answers, either,
but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things
about the US system, at least in principle.

Because sometimes that's necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when
it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.

#
#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?

IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various
kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive 
the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of
liar's paradox: "force is necessary for freedom".   One possible justification
is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if
their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if
we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.

I pointed out the secession movement in Aceh which has also been
brutally dealt with in the past by the Indonesian government.  The
harshly with all secessionist movements.
the evidence, it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealt
very harshly with all secession movements.

I know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long time
was Benny Murdani -- a "Christian".  Indonesia has been heavy handed in
East Timor for a long time , even when Murdani was head of the armed
forces.  The people who make up the
Indonesian government are in general motivated by national interests,
not religious ones.

I know of a similar incident about 3 years ago.  A climatologist( Ithink 
that was his profession) named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake 
would hit the New Madrid fault on Dec.3.  Some schools in Missouri that were 
on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day.  Many people 
evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are.  I wouldn't be suprised if 
there were more journalists in the area than residents.  Of course, teh 
earthquake never occured.  HOw do I know about his?  I used to live in 
Southern Illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the 
fault line.  No we still had school... We laughed at the poor idiots who 
believed the prediction. :):):):)

Bob, if you're wanting an excuse to convert to Christianity, you gonna have 
to look elsewhere.

Gregg, so would you consider that Rushdie would now be left alone,
and he could have a normal life? In other words, does Islam support
the notion of forgiving?

This is an interesting notion -- and one I'm scared of. In my
case I'm a Finnish citizen, I live in USA, and I have to conform
to the US laws. However, the Finnish government is not actively
checking out what I'm doing in this country, in other words checking
out if I conform to the Finnish laws.

However, Islamic law seems to be a 'curse' that is following you
everywhere in the world. Shades of 1984, eh?

If this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just
exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple.

Whether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or
not, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear
of their life for words.

It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the
worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that?
You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you
quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support
threatening the life of someone for words, you are not yet civilized.

This is exactly where I, and many of the people I know, have to depart
from respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and
encourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.

You, or I or anyone, are more than privledged to believe that someone,
whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover, is beyond the pale
of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul, refuse to allow
any members of your association to interact with him/her, _peacably_
demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from
the "miscreants", or whatever, short of physical force.

But once you physically threaten, or support physical threats, you get
much closer to your earlier comparison of rape - with YOU as the rapist
who whines "She asked for it, look how she was dressed".

Blaming the victim when you are unable to be civilized doesn't fly.

If the first rule of humor is never having to say you're sorry then the 
second rule must be never having to explain yourself.  Few things are 
worse that a joke explained.  In spite of this, and because of requests
for me to post my list o' nicknames, I must admit that no such list
exists.  It was simply a plot device, along with me being the keeper
o' the list, to make the obvious play on the last name of Fuller and to
advance the idea that such a list should be made.

I assumed that the ol' timers would recognize it for what it is.  
Nevertheless, how about a list o' nicknames for alt.atheism posters?
If you think of a good one, just post it and see if others like it.
We could start with those posters who annoy us the most, like Bobby or
Bill.

Sure. Yes, I did. You see I don't think that rape and murder should
be dealt with lightly. You, being so interested in leniency for
leniency's sake, apparently think that people should simply be
told the "did a _bad_ thing."

Misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible.
I suspect that it's pretty unlikely that, given my requirement

This is an argument for why _you_ don't like religions that suppress
sex. A such it's an irrelevant argument.

If you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then 
fine. My response is then: you have given no reason for your statement
that sex is not the business of religion (one of your "arguments").

The urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong
measures are required to suppress it. If the urge to have sex is so
strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to
find a marriage partner.

Basically, any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy 
hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in 
Florida.  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets
and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.

Never mind that, but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought

      So long as you keep that "almost" in there, freedom will be a
mostly valuable thing, to most people. That is, I think you're really
saying, "a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable
to them". That's good, and a quite nice starting point for a moral

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here,
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.

    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side.

Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for
1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128... time slices?

This requires the same total exposure time, and the same precision in
timing, but drastically reduces the image-preparation time, no?

A 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100

rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are
already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the

3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip
sets will be in full production.  The number of software companies
designing titles for the box will be over 300.

How do I know this?  I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters
last week.  Some folks were bullshitting a little too loudly about
company business.

	Does anybody know if there are any good 2d-graphics packages
	available for IBM RS/6000 & AIX ? I'm looking for something
	like DEC's GKS or Hewlett-Packards Starbase, both of which
	have reasonably good support for different output devices
	like plotters, terminals, X etc.

	I have tried also xgks from X11 distribution and IBM's implementation
	of Phigs. Both of them work but we require more output devices
	than just X-windows.

	Our salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics and
	I am not expecting for any good solutions from there.

Actually I am trying to write something like this but I encounter some
problems, amongst them:

- drawing a 3d wireframe view of a quadric/quartic requires that you have
the explicit equation of the quadric/quartic (x, y, z functions of some
parameters). How to convert the implicit equation used by PoV to an
explicit one? Is it mathematically always possible?

I don't have enough math to find out by myself, has anybody heard about
useful books on the subject?

  For a commerical package try WAVE from  Precision Visuals
                                           505-530-6563

  For a free package try KHOROS from University of New Mexico
                                      508-277-6563
                                   ftp from
                              ptrg.eece.unm.edu

    Login in anonyomus or ftp  with a valid email address as the password
               cd /pub/khoros/release

   That will get you to the right place.

I sure did use version 3.2. It works fine with most software but NOT
with Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me. Pretty
useless program without that thing working IMHO.
So I hope the author can fix that.

They need a hit software product to encourage software sales of the product,
i.e. the Pong, Pacman, VisiCalc, dBase, or Pagemaker of multi-media.
There are some multi-media and digital television products out there already,
albeit, not as capable as 3DO's.  But are there compelling reasons to buy
such yet?  Perhaps someone in this news group will write that hit software :-)

>How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a 
>set of points, edges and faces? 

Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which
are connected by at least one edge.

If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.  

If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface "flips" when
you travel across that edge.  This is bad.  

Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise
acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the
surface enforcing consistency with that edge.  

    0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as "OK"
    1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)
       make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face
       should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which
       are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as "OK",
       and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially
       inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)). 
    2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.

If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you
lose. 
    
Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means
that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding
which way is OUT is left as an exercise...

On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for
use with the curses library.  Guess what they provide? :-)

Unix Press, ie. Prentice-Hall, has a programmer's guide for these
tools, referred to as the FMLI (Forms Mgmt Language Interface) and
ETI (Extended Terminal Interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  It is
ISBN 0-13-020637-7.

Paraphrased from the outside back cover:

    FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,
    and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library
    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
    for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.

The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a
"shell-like" environment of the "fmli" program and it's database
files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.

The ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide
support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
with controls built on top of the curses library.

Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...

Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects
for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer
graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each
frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics
would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames
per second).

It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.
True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual
databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This
is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of
the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion
of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system
must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
data representations.

Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15
frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps
due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the
graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant
frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general
does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the
UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time
operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. 
Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time
operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not
even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our
multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due
to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.

From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments
requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time
multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems
on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2
systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly
important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.


|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR
|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?

You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are
off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,
being targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most
popular are (in no particular order):

	- Division Inc.		    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS
	- Sens8 Inc.		    (Sausalito, CA)    - WorldToolKit
	- Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA)     - NPSnet (FREE!)
	- Gemini Technology Corp    (Irvine, CA)       - GVS Simation Series
	- Paradigm Simulation Inc.  (Dallas, TX)       - VisionWorks, AudioWorks
	- Silicon Graphics Inc.	    (Mountain View,CA) - IRIS Performer

There are some others, but not off the top of my head...

In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed "movies".
They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale "movie" of
Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it
had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many 
other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what
kind of software/hardware was used for creating the "movies" I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as
I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you
put 11 minutes on one floppy disk?

My opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case I 
will probably change my mind.

Yes but a key issue is _SPEED_ how fast is Imagine? And is it as easy to
use
as 3D Studio? Can it just do a render as fast as 3DS if you don't want
things like IOR etc.. 3DS can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps,
animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the IPAS routines 
(Not that I've ever seen them) It can do explosions, top quality
morphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc..
I'm not knocking imagine, I just want to know how it compares with 3DS




 Recently I saw the latest Computer Shopper and in it there was an article
on nice shareware graphics programs. They looked pretty good and of the 6
listed in the article, one I had (Graphics Workshop), one I found via
archie (Draft Choice - old version though) and the rest I couldn't find.
So if there is anyone that knows where I can get the following programs
via anonymous ftp, please let me know.

Adkins Graphics :AG1.ZIP, AG2.ZIP
Draft Choice (latest VGA version) : DRAFTC.ZIP
Envision Publisher: ENVIS1.ZIP, ENVIS2.ZIP
Neopaint: NEOPNT.ZIP

The following is extracted from sumex-aim.stanford.edu.  It should also be on
the mirrors.  I think there is source for some applications that may have some
bearing on your project.  Poke around the source directory.  I've never used
this package, nor do I know anyone who did, but the price is right :-)

Hope this helps.

Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:
-------------------------------------

Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing three-dimensional scenes? 

Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of three-dimensional molecules?

And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it?

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to 
do with this package???' , read on.

GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines 
for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating 
(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) 
three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.

GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on). 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)

GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above 
processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.
Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D
graphics and how to use the package.

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. 
However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.

GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.


Enjoy,
Christian Franz

Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland
fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc. 
I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which
converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and
Polyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc).
The program has a lot nice features.
So if interested give me a mail.

A book that I can somewhat recommend is :
                     
                     Pratical Image Processing in C
                     by Craig A. Lindley
                     published by Wiley

It addresses reading/writing to/from PCX/TIFF files; image acquisition, 
manipulation and storage; and has source code in the book. The source is 
primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities. I 
have converted some of it to Quick C. Naturally, the code has some problems 
in the book - as usuall. Typos, syntax, etc. are problems. It can be a good 
learning experience for someone who is studying C. There is also a companion 
disk with source available for order and $50.00. Overall, the book is not 
bad. I acquired the book at WaldenSoftware.



Hi,

Can anybody suggest robust algorithms/code for computing the point of intersection
on n, 2-d lines in a plane. The data has outliers and hence a simple least squares
technique does not seem to provide satifactory results.

Please respond by e-mail and I will post the summary to the newsgroups
if there is sufficient interest.

Hi there,

I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone
here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but
are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an
intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.

*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it
*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a
*** different version.

The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They
are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,
anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a
"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with
no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a
simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256
color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".

The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip 
It is zipped with pkzip 2.04g

It is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do with
it whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due,
and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)

The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by
the European partners of Motorola. It has some integrated I/O controllers
and half a MMU, but otherwise it's a 68010. Think of it the same as
the 8086 and 80186 were.

  Is there any program available (free or otherwise) for taking a tiff or gif
or some other bitmapped file and turning it (or parts of it) into ascii
characters?

  DOS, OS/2 or platform independent programs if possible.

  Thanks.

There is a vast literature on Delaunay triangulations, literally
hundreds of papers.  A program is even provided with every copy of 
Mathematica nowadays.  You might look at this if you are interested in 
using it for creating 3D objects:

@article{Boissonnat5,
  author = "J.D. Boissonnat",
  title = "Geometric Structures for Three-Dimensional Shape Representation",
  journal = "ACM Transactions on Graphics",
  month = "October",
  year = {1984},
  volume = {3},
  number = {4},
  pages = {266-286}
}




The 68070 _does_ exist. It's number was licensed to Philips to make their
own variant. This chip includes extra featurfes such as more I/O ports, 
I2C bus... making it more microcontroller like.

Because of the confusion with numbering (!), Philips other products in the
[range with the 68??? core have been given differend numbers like PCF...
or PCD7.. or something.



I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question.  If not,
please forgive me and point me in the right direction.

Does anybody know of a program that converts .GIF files to .BMP files
and if so, where can I ftp it from?  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Please respond via e-mail as I do not read this group very often.

Thanks...Scott

hi all,

IN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing
	  on SVGA graphics.

COMPLETE:
	I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular
graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)

Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.

Platform: 386/486 class machine.
	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics
		(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering
		 purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for
		 speed reason.)
         (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA
          cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)

What I'm looking for?
1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes
   on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.
   Presumably in assembly languagine.
	Yes, VERY FAST please.
2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.
   Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of
   text, else later.
   (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)
2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the 
   project.

Final remarks;-
non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.

	Any help is appreciated.
	thanks

	Hi, I'm looking for the 3-D studio driver for the

	Maybe I should have just gotten a more well know card.

Help!  I'm trying to program my VGA!  I've got it working
with in pascal with the following routines for mode $13h
(320*200*256).  I've got a VESA compatable Trident 8900C w/1meg
and need to program in 1024*768 mode.  I don't care how many colors.
 
Could someone take this code and help me write 2 new procedures to
replace them so that it'll work in 1024*768*16 or 1024*768*256?
 
That'd be GREAT!  Thanks...
 
Here is the code I currently have for 320*200*256 mode:
 
  Procedure GraphMode;
 
    Begin { VideoMode }
      Asm
        Mov  AH,00
        Mov  AL,13h
        Int  10h
      End;
    End;  { VideoMode }
 
  Procedure PlotPoint (x, y, c : Integer);
 
    Begin
      Mem[$A000:x+y*320]:=c;
    End;

The problem is not precisely defined above, but if you need to find
the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon, then
you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon.  There
are two ways to do this:  use a somewhat tricky but by-now well
examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary,
or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull
routine and accept O(n log n).  Both methods are discussed in
Preparata and Shamos, for example.



To everyone who wants fonts in Vivid/POV/Polyray.
The Borland BGI font converter is VVFONT18.ZIP.
This program can be found on FTP.INFORMATIK.UNI-OLDENBURG.DE directory
pub/dkbtrace/utils.
Also WUARCHIVE has mirrored this site (directory graphics/graphics/mirrors/
ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/pub/dkbtrace/utils.
There are more nice utilities present in this directory.
A new version of Polyray 1.6 (for those asked for it) can be found on the 
same sites but in the directory INCOMING instead of UTILS (PLY16386).
Also in this directory POVSHELL and PV3DV060 could be found.

A 68070 is just a 68010 with a built in MMU.  I don't even think that Moto.
manufactures them.

Howdy all,

	I was wondering if people could e-mail me their opinions on
the various graphics viewers available for MS-Windows 3.x...  I'm
working on a project to set up our scanner and write documentation on
how to use it and it would be nice to have a snazzy image viewer 
to look at (and maybe even edit?) the image you just scanned.

The file formats I'm looking for:

GIF
JPEG
TIFF
PCX
whatever other 'major' file formats there are.

Thanks a lot for your help

Well, how about those of us who have 1400-picture CD-ROMS and would like to use
CVIEW because it is fast and it works well, but can't because the moron lacked
the foresight to create the temp file in the program's path, not the current

I finally got a 24 bit viewer for my POVRAY generated .TGA files.

It was written in C by Sean Malloy and he kindly sent me a copy.  He
wrote it for the same purpose, to view .TGA files using his SpeedStar 24.

It ONLY works with the SpeedStar 24 and I cannot send copies since it is
not my program.  I believe the author may release a version at a future
time when the program is more developed.   He may or may not comment on
this, as he pleases.

Thanks to all who were helpful.

I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working
code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method
looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in 
Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.

I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor
of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either
case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution
of linear equations).

To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,
P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from P1 to P2.
These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting
center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points
(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like
I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which
will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to
find).

Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets
of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define
the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the
lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique
point if they are not parallel.

Ho boy. There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do

Hello netters

Sorry, I don't know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing,
probably should be a CFV, but since I don't have tha ability to create a 
news group myself, I just want to start the discussion. 

I enjoy reading c.g very much, but I often find it difficult to sort out what
I'm interested in. Everything from screen-drivers, graphics cards, graphics
programming and graphics programs are discused here. What I'd like is a 
comp.graphics.programmer news group.
What do you other think.

What about the ELSA WINNER4000 (S3 928, Bt485, 4MB, EISA), or the

As it just happens, SGCS has a Xserver (X386 1.4) that does

RADIOSITY SOURCES WANTED !!!
============================

When I read the comp.graphics group, I never found something about 
radiosity. Is there anybody interested in out there? I would be glad 
to hear from somebody.
I am looking for source-code for the radiosity-method. I have already
read common literature, e. g.Foley ... . I think little examples could 
help me to understand how radiosity works. Common languages ( C, C++, 
Pascal) prefered.
I hope you will help me!

Yours
Peter 




First off: Thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the
68070. I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for
further enhancements to the Motorola line, rather than meted out to
another company. Ah, well, I guess that's what I get when I assume the
computer industry will operate in a logical manner! ;-)

Version 1.5 of Quicktime is, as has been stated, the current version of
the software. The older version is 1.0, and 1.6 is on the horizon in the
not too distant future.

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
does playing back resized movies. Apparently the process of expanding
each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
bit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work
pretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x
size or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.

He lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by
the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the
same amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in
order to keep the sound and video synced up.

The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar
performance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I
was using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.
The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice
speakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,
the QT player Apple includes with the software.

>   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.

No problem -- it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the
things it does as well as it can.

Help!
How do you write to the second bank/page of memory when in VGA
320x200x256 colour mode?. ie: to perform page flipping animation
and buffering of the screen.
     I have tried using the Map Mask Registers, but this does not
perform the required task (Although it does do something).

Note: It *must* be able to work on a standard VGA (ie: not
necessarily a SVGA card).

Many thanx in advance...

Hi! Everyone,

Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess
my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:

The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which
rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse
and its offset is same everywhere.

This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.
The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the
positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still
an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial
Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was
implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold
internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!
How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most
importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?

I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year
to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this
problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)
is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire
or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from
a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not
analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things
complicated. Please give me a hint.

I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.
However, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits".
Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

Please post here and let the others share our interests 
(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the
summary of the answers).

I am trying to convert an m-motion (IBM) video file format YUV to RGB 
data...

THE Y portion is a byte from 0-255
THE V is a byte -127-127
THe color is U and V
and the intensity is Y

DOes anyone have any ideas for algorhtyms or programs ?

Can someone tell me where to get info on the U and V of a television signal ?

IF you need more info reply at the e-mail address...
Basically what I am doing is converting a digital NTSC format to RGB (VGA)
for displaying captured video pictures.

Thanks.


THE U is a byte -127-127

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I
is running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long
time ago.

   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for
making cool awesome games (read psygnosis).

There are several public domain utilities available at your usual
archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl
file, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp.  The problem 
is that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
the many pd format converters I have used. Any hint welcome!
Let me know if you have problems locating the utilities.
Hope it helps.

That's closer, but I dislike "apps".  "software" (vs. "hardware")
would be better.  Would that engulf alt.graphics.pixutils?  Or would
that be "programmer"?

I don't know if traffic is really heavy enough to warrant a newsgroup
split.  Look how busy comp.graphics.research is (not).

It's true that a lot of the traffic here is rehashing FAQs and
discussing things that would probably be better diverted to
system-specific groups, but I don't know whether a split would help
or hurt that cause.

Maybe we need a comp.graphics.RTFB for all those people who can't be
bothered to read the fine books out there.  Right, Dr. Rogers? :-)

I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder,
I think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in
SCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main
file menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions,
of course, in which case you're on your own!!!

Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time)
did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the
pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an
afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow
strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!

The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill -
so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then
grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the
final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the
shape of the object being filled!!!

Of course, if the recorder isn't a QCR, you can ignore all
this and feel suitably :-)

Cheers, Toby.

I've used that reference, and found that I needed to go to their
original tech report:

	Maureen Stone and Tony DeRose,
	"Characterizing Cubic Bezier Curves"
	Xerox  EDL-88-8, December 1988

This report can be obtained for free from:
Xerox Corporation

The TOG paper was good, but this tech report had more interesting details ;-)

There are 2 books published by M&T BOOKS that come with C source code on
floppies.  They are:

Programming In 3 Dimensions, 3-D Graphics, Ray Traycing, and Animation
by: Christopher D. Watkins and Larry Sharp.

Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C
by: Christopher D. Watkins, Stephen B. Coy, and Mark Finlay.

I have the first book and it is a great intro to 3-D, Ray Tracing and
Animation.  Most of the programs are on the disk compiled and ready to run.

I have only glanced at the second book but it also appears to be good.

Hope this helps!

Hello,

Can anybody help me with the conversion of pic format files
to HPGL files. The question is as follows:

Is it possible to convert files that have been generated in the
pic preprocessor format into HPGL format, suitable for sending
to a plotter. The hardware involved is IBM RISC/6000 running AIX
3.2.3. How should this be done and what software is involved,
where is it available, what does it cost, what are the problems?

Regards,

Dani

I have heard some impressive things about Hijakk (for Windows).
Currently, I use a shareware program called Graphics Workshop.
What kinds of things will Hijaak do that these shareware programs
will not do?

What has been your experience with Hijaak? Are there other programs
that are better? Please email me, if you can help:

Thanks!






For those who are interested in Ray Traced pictures, there is a nice example
on alt.binaries.pictures.misc. The file is called Poolball.gif. It shows a
pooltable with... YES! ... poolballs!
Resolution: 1024x768,  colours: 256 (only).
The TGA (24 bit) version is also available, but a bit big (2.4Mb) to post.
The picture is created with POV-ray.




Enjoy!

On a related topic, I have been searching (with no success)
for a specification of the Enhanced Metafile format.  I have
the original WMF format (Graphics File Formats, Levine et al),
but no info on the 32 bit version.

Any pointers ?

Hi,

My name is rahul and I am doing MS at USU, Logan
My query is:
	I have a HP workstation: HP Series 400 with X running on it.
I have a true color - 24bit color monitor connected to this machine.
Normally I have the capability to display 256 colors from a max of
16.7 million. Since the monitor is True Color I can see 16.7
million at a time. 
Que: do we have a facility in X(c-function call) that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen? I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of 256 colors.
Que: If not. Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls?

We are generating ray traced images and 256 colors are indeed a
painful limit. besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification.
Please, if anyone can help i'd be obliged

Have you considered the Apple Laserwriter IIg. We use it for all our B&W
image printing.



If this question is covered elsewhere, I apologize, but I need information
fast.

My department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system
on our network of IBM RS6000 workstations.  This is not an area in which I
have any expertise, so I wonder if anyone out there can offer advice.  We
would like a system, based either on VHS or 8mm video which will allow one 
write video, frame by frame on tape for play-back in real time.  It's for
visualization of physics problems.  Can anyone tell me what hardware is
available which would work for our system?  Some support software is
obviously needed too, but nothing particularly sophisticated, since the
software we actually use for the visualization is all already written.

Please email with replies, as I don't read this group.  Many thanks for your

I don't know about that...I've used Photoshop 2.5 on both a 486dx-50 and a Quadra
950...I'd say they are roughly equal.  If anything the 486 was faster.

Both systems were running in 24 bit color and had the same amount of RAM (16 megs)
I also believe the quadra had one of those photoshop accelerators.



I've been trying to figure out a way to get Adobe Illustrator
to auto-trace >exactly< what I see on my screen. But it misses
the edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more - resulting in images
that are useless  - I need exact tracing, not approximate.

I've tried adjusting the freehand tolerances as well as autotrace
tolerances but it doesn't help. Any suggestions?

For some reason I never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are
looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a PC, you really can't go past
the mode X stuff from Dr Dobbs. This code is all p.domain (as far as I know),
and in the original articles, the routines were all presented as dumb vga
routines, and then optimised to modeX with some interesting discussion along
the way.
If you are interested, I could find out more details of the issues in question,
(I have them at home).

Bernard.



I'm posting this for a friend:

  I have an immediate need for a polygon-based hidden-line removal  
  program.  I can deal with any input/output format, but I need to be able  
  to do perspective views in any orientation and range.

  Is there a public-domain hidden-line program around?  It seems like  
  there should be, but I have not been able to locate one.

Email replies and I will summarize.
Thanks

I went back and looked at the review again.  They claim there were
significant differences in manipulating a 27 meg test file, but with
smaller files, the two platforms were the about the same.  David

I've had exactly the same problems in Aldus Freehand.  I think autotracing
is one of those "features" that barely works, but everybody feels compelled
to throw it in because the other guys are doing it.  :)

Hi Noel,

I've made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts,
triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic
3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which
triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited
to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code
example of how to do it.

Another way to do the bartman may be

- TGA2POV
- A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.

  Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript
  previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,
  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open
  on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.

Example:

object {
   union {
      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" }
      height_field { gif "abp2.gif" scale <1 -1 1>}
   }
   texture {
      Glass
   }
   translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center
   rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards
   scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker
   translate <0 2 0>            // final placement
}


abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing "ABP" black on white in
Times-Roman 256 points.

Speaking of Psygnosis, they have licensed games to Philips Interative
Media International for CD-I.

The following was recently posted in a message in the CD-I section of
the Multimedia Forum.

"Seventh Guest has been licensed by Virgin Games to Philips Interactive
Media International for worldwide CD-I rights. Were also licensed to
P.I.M.I. Litil Divil from Gremlin Graphics (UK) and Microcosm from
Psygnosis (UK). Those three titles will be adapted on CD-I using the full
potential of the FMV cartridge, meaning, using the additional memory as
well as the motion video capabilities. Those titles have been negociated
in Europe but will be available worldwide.

Also, Lemmings 1 & 2 have been licensed from Psygnosis, as well as Striker
Soccer from Rage (UK)."

I don't know when these titles will be available or when work on them even
started (so don't expect your CD-I retailer to have them yet).

There was also some mention of future Nintendo CD-I games in an issue of the
UK magazine ERT - Mario Hotel was mentioned as having 75 levels.

I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature.
This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line
looks better on low resolution devices.

The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They
also give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScript
environments where it is absent.

The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints
of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:

	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25
	
Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  From
reading I thought that what they might actually do is:

	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25
	
This results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" 
whichever is closer.

By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that
neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS
result looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if
anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.

Thanks,

They are 3D object files for CAD 3D 2.0, a program written by Tom Hudson
for the Atari ST computers.  Don't know much more about them except that
they are stored with the points first, then the surfaces are next, and are
made by listing 3 point numbers that make up the triangle surface. Then
there's a header that describes coloring, lighting, etc.  Don't know much
more than this, hope this helps.

Does anyone have the documentation for the MS Mouse Driver 8.2?  I got it when  
I got Windows 3.1, but my Windows manual does not come with the documentation.   
In particular I need to know how to turn it off, and how to speed it up  
outside windows.  The greater sensitivity is needed so I can play various  
games, esp X-wing :)

I've been running Dos 6 for about a month.  I was generally impressed with
the improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, the
new commands were nice, and DoubleSpace worked fine (twice as slow for
large data transfers, twice as fast for small with SmartDrv).

Until now.

This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper, I had to
reboot a hung Dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within Windows 3.1.
When my machine finished rebooting, I found my windows directory and about two
thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.

I cannot afford problems like this.  I'm returning to Dos 5.

P.S.  I've also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should
      exist.



Does anyone know where I can ftp or somehow else acquire the latest

Are you using Windows 3.0 or 3.1? If you're still on 3.0, 3.1 devotes about
twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently. If 3.1,
you might use one of the resource monitors (such as the one that comes with
the Windows 3.1 Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available)
to see which programs are hogging the resources (every icon, internal
graphics brush, etc. in every program running uses a certain amount of
this limited memory area. Also, some don't give it back when they're
finished).

Apparently not. Many people complain about the confusion that
results from the filemanager/progman split. It's just a basic
flaw.

Besides, what about the control panel icons? Where are all those
little files?

Nathan,
  Win31 has a fixed limit of 64K GDI memory, regardless of physical RAM
installed, this is twice that of Win30, but not nearly robust enough for
many developers and power users.
 
Using Amish Launch as your shell, you can reduce GDI memory usage by as
much as 15% over Progman, NDW 2, DAshboard, and other graphical type icon
based and other shells.  Also, nesting, and full hot-key global support
is offered, something no other shells have at this time.

Not true! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality
at any size. It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs
related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason
for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the
market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font
vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being
hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted
TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.

TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting
of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the
Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can
be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not
just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.

> You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time, if you like.

Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone
converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT
allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs
in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate
for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack
2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that
if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.

     Don't bother if you have CPBackup or Fastback.  They all offer options 
not available in the stripped-down MS version (FROM CPS!).  Examples - no 
proprietary format (to save space), probably no direct DMA access, and no 
tape drive!

     You NEED MS Defrag if you use doublespace to work on the compressed 
volume.

I believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on 
ftp.cica.indiana.edu
in pub/pc/win3/nt called something like nwnt.zip

There is an INDEX ascii file there, which lists the programs in that directory
and what they do.

unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcp/ip over your
primary nic, so if you really want to run it, get yourself an extra nic and
bind it to that.  

Otherwise wait for next release, like I am.

Has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging
after the installation of DOS 6?  I have narrowed the
problem down to EMM386.

If if remove (or disable) EMM386, windows is ok.  If EMM386
is active, with NOEMS, windows hangs.  If I use AUTO with
EMM386, the system hangs on bootup.

Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters.
And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI
in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac. 
No difference there between T1 and TT!   

And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters
is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there
is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')

Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.

The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,
you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a
font may very well have them.

ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a
new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow
you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the
`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?

I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem. I tried a mouse on COM3, IRQ4 (the
usual place) and it still did not like it. Simply, Windows seems to only
support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that
Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse
sitting on COM3. Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least
support COM3? :-)

I've tried this too. Actually, I wanted to be able to use my second
modem (COM3/IRQ5) from Windows. It still will not talk to that modem. I
created two profiles, AMSTRAD (for my Amstrad modem on COM1/IRQ4) and
MAESTRO (for my Maestro on COM3/IRQ5). It will not talk to the Maestro
at all.

If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ10 as well.

We have a LAN where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms. 
For the moment we are only working on MAC and DOS/Windows. The department has   
always used sneaker net to transport files to the MAC, since it requires a      
filter to strip out the <LF> characters.                                        

Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as   
a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together   
at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying  
to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will  
allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                            

I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC 
product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                       

I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume that
ours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?  What solutions have  
you come up with?

They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET.INI and QVTHOST.RC are
incorrect (see below).

No, I don't think so. You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't
you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX)
should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using
different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently.

>This is the qvthost.rc file.
>137.112.5.2

There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses.
Your file should look like this:

137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver>
137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router>

>This is the beginning of the winqvt.ini file.
>[net]
>name=swartzjh.test.rose-hulman.edu

Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part.

>router=137.112.199.50

Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC
I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also,
but  apparently they don't.

>nameserver=137.112.5.2

Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the
IP address.

It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than
one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to
three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.

Hope it helps,
Richard

	ahh, yes, this is a fun topic.  No, once the name is incribed on the

the windows version....it got really great reviews in computer shopper.
I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here
using it, but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the
modem....he has a 14,400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine.  I can't
see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,
but the windows just seems to always screw up....Is this common
and is there a fix?  Or is something just screwed with his machine?

Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card!  My 9600 baud
modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X. I get
about 7 million WinMarks on my 386-25 and it just about keeps up with the
modem speed (using procomm plus for windows, too).  He should get over
10 million on his machine with the same card.  Anything 10+ should yield
acceptable speed...

	I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well, until I
finally got hold of the shareware binary editor BEAV133, and dug into
NOTEPAD.EXE (there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to 
0.0 margins- it's hardwired into code!!!). 

	Do a SEARCH for ".75", then change the offending bytes to ".00", 
et viola. Who are the guys who hardcode these "options" anyway?

	I'm interested in whether the problem only rears it's ugly head for 
certain printers- I'm using an old Epson LX-800 (or is that EX-800? never can 
remember).

aloha.



Does anyone out there know if there are print drivers for Windows for the
Panasonic KX-P1091i 9-pin dot matrix printer?




I had a similar problem - try changing the netmask to 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.254.0

You can change it. As part of a continuously downsizing Government
organization, my code (branch) changes about once a year. I just
finished changing the registration information using Norton Utilities.
I sent the original requester the hex offset into USER.EXE containing
the information, and his reply indicated he got several similar answers.

And it's not encoded in any way. As for the legality, there's nothing
that keeps me from changing the information; it certainly doesn't reach
out and alter the serial number printed on the inside of my manual.

But the impressive performance of the Graphite was
not its Winmark, it was its Wintach result (esp. the paint
performance). Judging from the Wintach tests, I can hardly
imagine that there is a cheat driver for it.

One of the rules for a permanent swap file is that it must be contiguous
(non-fragmented) space.  I suspect that is more responsible for the
difference than the amount of free disk, in your case.

It depends on what you are running.  We had to increase our swap
file (I think it is now 20MB) when some applications couldn't
run without *everything* else closed.

On a similar note, has anyone found out a way to do this with MS FoxPro for
Windows? My setup.ini file was modified on disk 1 (all encrypted).. Well,
of course I forgot about Microsoft's stupid arrangement when I got the 
software, and used my name (it was paid for by the company I'm doing 
consulting for. When my job is done, it's their software).. Any ideas before
I start doing dumb things to a copy of that file??

Mattias
ps NO - I don't want to pirate this software. I just want to avoid having
to buy a new copy in order to change the registration information and then
having a copy lying around I don't use...

maybe I can get a new disk 1...

I'm using PC Plus at home on my trusty old NEC 386 SX/20 with a 14,400

Does anybody have any idea where I could find a program that can

I can get from an ftp site somewhere...

I just installed a new TrueType font under MS-Windows 3.1
but though all the applications display the font correctly on the
screen, quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly
(on a LaserJet 4 - non-PostScript printer).

When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assume
CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer.

But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square
boxes in place of the characters of the new font. Yet, Write does
display the font correctly on the screen.

I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere.
All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print
exactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a font
has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????

Appreciate any help....



I've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550C from Word
for Windows.

History: when I had a Deskjet 500, I had to modify the macro so that
it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that
interferred with printing envelops.  That bug is still present, however...

Now: the problem I have is that my DeskJet 550 print driver (came with
the printer I bought in December) still wants to print the envelops in
PORTRAIT mode.  However, the DeskJet 550 feeds envelops the from the
narrow end (i.e. landscape mode).  How do I get the printer to print
the envelops in the correct orientation?

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not post this to the net since:
    (a) due to end of the semester cruch, I can't keep up on these groups,
and (b) I will summarize the best answer(s) to the net anyhow!

Thanks in advance,
Craig Stevenson

Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review:

1.  Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown
    by the Graphite and #9GXE's "cheating".  Can't they just admit that
    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach
    is much harder to beat...

2.  The big "cheat" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and
    PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't
    do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing
    PC Magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn't they
    at least make some comment about its real-world performance?

I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve
Gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx
Draw to benchmark).  If you believe Gibson, that is ... :)  He writes:

    "Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world
     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than
     any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it's
     just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I
     have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the
     ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB."

This kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench
or not!  :)

> When and if you get one send me mail.. I might buy that ATI GU+ off

I already returned the ATI GU+.  My dealer had sold eight of them, and 
seven were returned to him.  I'm now (temporarily) back to running an
original ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in
my 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where
you use BitBlits).

Hercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you
can buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.  At
just $199 for Graphite or $249 for the VLB version I decided it was worth
trying (I'm supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks).  I'll post
my impressions when I get it...

	First of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is
a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed
to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so
much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not
 justified...
Please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time (by the way c.o.msw.misc is
OK :) ). Now as far as your problem is concerned: try playing around with
the settings in the 'Fonts..." dialog box under the window control menu (that
little square at the top left corner of the window..).

Dear friend,
  The RISC means "reduced instruction set computer". The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance. You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC.

Hello.

     I purchased a video card called ET-4000 true color card which
     can provide about 1700K colors. But the question is I can't find
     the corresponding drivers for windows 3.1 , I am now using 65k
     colors driver for win31. It works fine , but I think it will be
     better if I use 1700k driver. So, please tell me whether such a
     driver is available !

     Thanks in advance.

	Hmmmm, why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of
those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win" and might even end up as "OS/2 Vs Win".
Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which
case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge... 
First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try
to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and
shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself
thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace-
ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will
even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan
does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do
that, huh? :) )... And the list goes on and on... Now, Windows _is_ kinda
hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not
paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine (an entirely differet
story ...)... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons
not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :)..
PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager... Modify your 
settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities
from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in the
discussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- they
are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writing
this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) )
By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under
the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS on
a PC !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )...
Just trying to avoid another Mac-Win war...

  I am sorry. My card can display about 17000K colors not 1700K colors.

  I hope some one could answer my question !

Hi,

  I recently bought an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280+. It's a real nice card,
but I'm having very big problems with it.

  The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display
in windows. Something like every other line or so.
Also, when I use a DOS gif viewer, namely vpic 6.0c, in Fahrenheit 1280
mode, vertical lines are swapped. It's very strange looking.
If it uses VESA standards, however, it works great! only it thinks there's
only 512K on the card. (There's 1MB on there).

  I have contacted Orchid support, and they tried to be helpful, but didn't
have the answer. I don't think the card is the problem, since it works great
on my friend's computer.

  Here is my setup:
Fahrenheit 1280+, 1MB, bios 1.1
386-25, Opti-chipset2, AMI bios 1990, 5MB ram.
Maxtor 120MB harddrive, (slave)
Maxtor 40Mb harddrive (master)
Panasonic c1381 monitor,
version 4.6 windows drivers.
windows 3.1
I tried taking all memory managers, etc off, and took all other cards
(besides disk controller) off.

  My friend's setup is 386sx-16, shamrock monitor.

If anyone has seen anything like this, or can otherwise help, I will be very
greatful.

Please send e-mail to tdarugar@tartarus.ucsd.edu or
			tdarugar@ebon.ucsd.edu

Tony.

I have (had) several problems with the card.
- Applications crashed when moving the mouse (VGA mode). Fixed by removing
  the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256
  does just fine.
- Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a
  256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning
  off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics
  mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.
  With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the
  window.
- The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware
  cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.
  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-
  for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-
  unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?
- The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal
  VESA drivers do not run at all).

I have an Okidata 2410 printer for which I would like to have a printer driver.
Has anyone seen such a thing?  There is not one on the Microsoft BBS.
I can print to it from Windows but I have no fonts available and with
Paradox for Windows I can't print labels on it unless there is a proper printer
defined.

I hope this will clear it up :

(Taken from one of my lecture notes)

 " ...  The alternative approach (to CISC),
 which has been adopted by many in
 recent years, has come to be known as "RISC": the Reduced
 Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as
 "Simpler is Faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing
 the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be
 designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more
 instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,
 faster design.

 A typical RISC processor will:

    o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);

    o perform all data operations on registers;

    o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');

    o only allow load & store operations to access memory;

    o only use a few instruction formats;

    o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).

I had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only
worked while I was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting
windows, however,the problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms.  I can't use 3 chip simms in my 
computer, and when I replaced them, the problem vanished, forever.



Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver?  There's
a "sound.exe" file that claims to be the driver but I'm suspicious since
it's not a .drv file.  

Thanks

Has anyone else been playing with that wincmd utility from PC Magazine?
If so, I am having trouble concatenating string variables together and
need your help.  For example:
temp = "path"
temp2 = "file.ext"
fullpath = temp+"/"
say fullpath			// output = 'th/'
fullpath = fullpath+temp2
say fullpath			// output = 'h/file.ext'

So, it seems to be dropping the first few characters with each
concatenations.  Is it that I am out of memory -- I only have maybe 20
variables total -- the article didn't mention memory limits. 

email me if you have an idea or would like to see the actual source and
output.  Thanks for your help.

I just got a copy of Tobias' Managing Your Money v9.0.  I have Quicken 6,
and it's wonderful for some things, but MYM seems to have some features
that Q6 doesn't.  For example, Q6 doesn't seem to be able to handle
monthly automatic deductions from a checking account (you know, a
monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from
my checking account).  Or is there something that I'm not doing right,
and Q6 can actually do that?  Anyway, MYM seems to be able to handle
monthly deductions.  In fact, it can apparently do better than that.
That is, you can specify monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, even yearly.
Anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs?
Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions?  Maybe
someone who has used both.  Or maybe someone who is familiar with
each could give me a capsule review?  Anything would be greatly
appreciated.  If I keep MYM, I have to pay for it, and I don't know
whether it's worth doing.  If MYM is better than Q6, of course I
will keep it.  But if Q6 can do everything MYM can do (maybe even
better), I won't.  Thanks all!

If you post a reply, please also cc me.  Thanks.



I am a novice (at best) in working with pc networks, and am in the
process of planning a small accounting system for a small business.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a
different office of the same building, each having access to a
Windows-based accounting system.

My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the
machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet
cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one
additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase
a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or
M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with
a report/check printer attached to it.
Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.

Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus out
there tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, however
trivial, will be immensely appreciated.  My apologies if this has been
brought up before.

Thanks!

Theoretically supposed to be reduced.... not any longer.  That's why everyone
is arguing about RISC v.s. CISC.  Personally, I think CISC will win out.
Just take a look at the Pentium!  (Not that I like Intel architectures either,
but that's another story...)

There are a couple.  I am personally using screenpeace, which is a
screen saver which will also select your wallpaper from a specified
directory (not necessarily the windows dir.).  Let me know if you want
info.  I've been pretty happy with screenpeace, and the latest version

Hi,

I have a 486/66MHz SYS based PC with 8M RAM and a problem.

What is the best way to configure high memory with QEMM/386MAX ??
I have a SPEEDSTAR 24X video card and use Hyperdisk disk cache
software. The problem is running Windows 3.1 in Enhanced mode and
having any high memory to load stuff high?

Note :
I tried, as recommended to exclude the region A000-C7FF but Windows
insists on starting in Standard mode.

Any suggestions?

Dan

Hey, sounds great. Does that mean that W4WG works with ODI? I thought it    
uses NDIS.                                                                  
                                                                            
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my    
UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work       
along.                                                                     
                                                                           
I read in a German computer magazine that TCP/IP support for W4WG is just  
around the corner. Anybody have any news about this?

Hi
I'm having a problem with TrueType fonts in WIndows 3.1. I have installed
the Cyrillic fonts I found on CICA and now a strange thing happens:
Sometimes windows uses Cyrillic when its supposed to use Times Roman.
Examples: The PC-Tools Backup (version 7.1) has one line of Cyrillic text
in its opening banner, the next to last line. Importing a Word for Windows
text written in Times into WP5.2 also results in Cyrillic.
Does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem?
Thanks

Hi
     I have never used MYM so I can not help you with the comparison of the
two products.  I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you
how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First
use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions. 
Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions
and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken
will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you
do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be
entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will
remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have
three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month,
middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.

Hi,
	We've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a
serial printer (dmp or Laser). I have used Works and Windows Write. The
output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output, but anything
fancy garbles or just doesn't output. The exception is outputting to a
Lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to
bother about handshaking messages. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I've
tried most of the Print/Network manager options I can think of. Anyone
had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it??
Thanks

John Atherton

PC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance
management programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World,
December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.
I can email you copies of these articles if you can't find them at your
library.

I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have
several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My
overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager
while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your
finances.

Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:

	The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:
	checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile
	your account statements with the records the program keeps.

	The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that
	budget.

	A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill
	paying service to pay your bills via your modem.
	
	The ability to print checks on your printer.

	The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.

	The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts
	up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically
	via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.

	The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation
	programs.


Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that
Quicken does not:

	A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to
	predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine
	tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.

	An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep
	records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.
	It can also compute your life expectancy.

	A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, 
	effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to
	maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and
	loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you 
	decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford
	a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good
	investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether
	a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.
	This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping
	your kids with their tuition.  

	A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets
	and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this 
	information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules
	are automatically included here.

	A "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file
	you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital
	information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a
	rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment
	list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to
	track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list
	can be made to display automatically when you start the program.

There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost
sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure
hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.

One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a 
Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version
of Managing Your Money for release late this year.

I hope this information is of use to you.  I've found Managing Your Money to
be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand
I know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all
the features you need or want, I'd go with it. If you find any of the Managing
Your Money features that Quicken doesn't have to be useful, I think it's well
worth the price.



Hello,

We are having troubles using the PC/TCP onpredir (printer redirection program
with lpr support) with the Windows print manager. The onpredir simply waits
an do only the capture till the end of the Windows session, while after some
printer inactivity  it should start the printing.
 Does anybody uses this two programs together?

I think George is referring to switch.zip in the ~ftp/pub/pc/win3/drivers/video

I have the local bus card also, and don't have any such problems with it
now, but this is the second card I've gotten - the first card didn't work
in VGA mode correctly.  Maybe they still have some quality control problems.
I would suggest checking with ATI (I went through the vendor I bought the
card from since the problem showed up immediately).  I never was able to
get through to ATI's technical support number.  

I sure like the way the card performs though.  I have the 2MB ATI ultra
pro - local bus, and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode.

The original RISCs had small instruction sets, and simple ones. The
idea was that a) every instruction should be completable in a single
clock cycle and b) to have no microcode and c) extensive pipelines.

A few comparisons (from Patterson: Reduced Instruction set computers.
CACM V28. 1, 1985):

CPU		Year	Instructions	Microcode
---		----	------------	---------
IBM 370/168	1973	208		420Kb
DEC VAX 11/780	1978	303		480Kb

While researching for the VLSI VAX, DEC discovered that 60% of the VAX
microcode is there to support 20% of the instruction set which
accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. The uVAX 32
subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software
emulator for these very complex instructions, the full VLSI uVAX
included the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but
only ranm 20% faster.

Is it possible to use WinQVT/Net on a machine that uses NDIS to connect to a
Token Ring ? I tried it with older versions (< 3.2) but got an invalid packet

Hi folks,

At the end of the summer I'm planning on getting a new computer (486DX50 or
486DX2/66) and have been poking around in Computer Shopper.  Anyway I saw
the ads for the Diamond Viper (Local Bus, 2MB memory, 50 million+ WinMarks)
and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it (good/bad/not worth
the money/etc.)  Any information at all would be nice.

Also, a few other questions.  Anyone know of a good cheap 15"+ 1024x768 NI
monitor?  And what is a good CD-ROM drive that meets MPC standards and is
controlled via SCSI?  How about a 250MB tape drive on SCSI?

Thanks for your time,
Brent Casavant

the first place.

Very simple.  You have to have the MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS loaded in DOS
before you run Windows.  Note that you don't need to have these files loaded
to use the mouse in Windows.

1) make sure your hard drive is defragmented. This will speed up more than 
   just windows BTW.  Use something like Norton's or PC Tools.
2) I _think_ that leaving the wall paper out will use less RAM and therefore
   will speed up your machine but I could very will be wrong on this.
There's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things
up.  good luck

I've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because I have the same requirements you do......and the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com1 and com2 using irq4 or irq3 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has them.....I've talked to Mouse Systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com1 and com2 as above , but who claim to be releasing one that will SOON!??.

The other alternative seems to be possible, but in one case prohibitively expensive, i.e. 4 port card for $600??????!!, and in the other, the author(s) of PowerBBS for Windows claim to have a 4 port serial card with buffered 16550 UARTS and drivers for windows to match (i.e. com3 irq5) for $120......

The second paragraph is hearsay, because I haven't checked it out yet.....but intend to as soon as I can free up $120 <g>

Hope this will save you some steps.




Greetings!
   
I've had a bunch of problems with the 24x.  Opening a DOS window on the
desktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set of
horizontal lines, hashing the entire desktop.  Nothing can recover this 
except to completely exit from Windows.  The other irritating problem is
that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually
scrolling, as if a CR was printed without an LF.  This seems ONLY to happen
to communications programs, but I can't nail it down any further than that.
Note, though, that the comms programs don't have to be communicating.  Even
just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in
these programs causes the problem.
   
   Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows, WPwin would sometimes
blow up, and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of
the problem.  I've still seen this, but only once or twice with WPwin 5.2.

WFWG does use NDIS but it cooperates well with the NDIS shim for ODI.
(I've heard that it is as fast as NDIS direct)

The additional TSR load is minimal.  I think I eat another  20K total.
This is worth it to me since it allows me to get to my Windows NT 
box.  Novell hasn't released a decent NT Novell client yet so I share
through my WFWG box.         
                                               
This solution is very usable.




A co-worker of mine needs to convert a postscript file to a form readable
(ie ascii) in windows or DOS. Does anybody know of a utility that will do
this? I have a vague memory of a shareware utility someone mentioned once...

Thanks for any info,

Barry.

I have a .BAT file that I run under a Windows Icon.  I have set up a PIF
file to run the BAT file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen.
The first line of the BAT file sets an environment variable.

My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows
3.1 in enhanced mode), the SET command in the BAT file fails with the
OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment 
space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that
I am nowhere near to running out.  If I just click on the MS-DOS icon,
I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.  The problem
is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in
a BAT file fails.  Has anyone seen such behavior before?  I see no place in the
PIF fail to configure environment space.

   -----Or, if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use
   Type 1 fonts. From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting
   TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in
   the first place.

Unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the
final output device (image setter).  A problem with TT fonts in Windows
is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used
while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result
is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the
printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look
good when printed at a different resolution.  

So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up for
this printer results, may be quite good.  But if you take a PS file made for
that printer and run it on a device of different resolution (such as an
image setter), then the results may not be so good.



Hey folks!

Just moments ago, I uploaded the Bungee Jumper After Dark module that
was widely talked about on here some time ago.

It's at ftp.cica.indiana.edu, in /pub/pc/win3/uploads, titled simply
bungee.zip.

Be sure to set your ftp connection to binary mode before downloading.
If you have any other After Dark shareware/freeware modules, please
upload them too.  The more the merrier.

Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for
Windows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia's
MS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors some
sites in the U.S.  The three I found were:

1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)
                                This was the smallest and simplest
   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.
   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra
   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the
   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press
   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would
   have been nice if there was an "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting for the little
   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified
   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be
   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace
   manager makes it an attractive package.

2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)
                               While this workspace manager offered a
   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming
   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace
   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take "snapshots"
   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what 
   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,
   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.
   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in
   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this
   viewing functionality which is quite useful.

3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)
                            This is an interesting package, which contains
   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies
   include "Backmenu", which provides a pop-up root menu when you
   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu
   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,
   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could
   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also
   bundled in "backdesk.zip" is a program called "WRUN", which allows
   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS
   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  
   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite
   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it
   doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.
   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,
   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to
   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different
   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which
   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window
   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically
   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area
   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up
   of a particular section.

Try each of them out for yourself.  I was impressed with all of them,
so find out which one suits your needs the best.

Do you mean that the Pentium is better than a Risc?  or that it will outsell
them all?  If the first, you have to remember that intel CISC (like the
pentium) are a always a generation away from the best riscs... also Riscs
cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities (not
even on the same order)...  but I remember reading about 3 years (maybe 2)
about a T800(?) from hypercube that did a 100 mips, was superscallar AND
reordered its instruction itself so




(1) Is it possible to change the icons in the program groups?  I'd like
    to give them some individuality.

(2) Can you set up a short-cut key to return to the Program Manager? 
    I know <CTL><ESC>, <ESC> will do it, but I'd rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the P/M with <ALT><F1>.

Any and all help is welcomed.

I use PlugIn, an enhancement to Program Manager. It allows (1) for sure, I

All right.  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give 
your question a shot. 

The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really 
have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need 
10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your 
pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not 
toner.  But that should go without saying.

My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little 
while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once 
the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out 
every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  

The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or 
HP wouldn't sell many......

Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built 
like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.

Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like 
a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not 
as impressive.  

So, I chose the Canon.  Any other opinions?



I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card. 
The driver I am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more 
than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory. 

The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable! They are still using 2400bps 
modem! It will take you hours to download the drivers, it hurts when you
are calling long distance. Is there any ftp site that has a collection
of video drivers for windows?

BTW, anyone using this card, and how do you like it so far?

Thanks.

Hi, 

I have a simple question. Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME
window without a title bar; ie

	(WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME) & ~WS_CAPTION 


I don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar.

I have another question:

I have a overlapped window(say V) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc)
The window shows up with all it's children fine. Now, I create another 
child(t) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of
it's siblings. Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it. How do
I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings.
I used SetWindowPos() and BringWindowToTop() without success. What's happening
is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go, it goes
behild it's siblings.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hello WinNetters:

I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of 
MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there 
with experience with the database package called "Approach".  It has gotten
a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it
would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access
because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a
field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it
seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz,
6 MB ram).

So, please provide me with your thoughts are "Approach", good and bad.  Thanks.

Hi,

sometime ago there are some discussions on gaining CompuServe access thru

refresh me where (which site) I can telnet to to gain access.

Hopefully I can download files as well.

ok, i have a 486dx50(ISA) w/ Diamond Stealth VRAM 1MB.
I was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows.
but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in DOS' VGA,
especially this new Strike Commander. ;-)
this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench).
my winmark was 6.35 million, i think.

so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully
can perform approx same w/ my current VRAM in windows and also
can perform DOS' VGA preferably >30fps.

i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it
in csipg and it looked that SpeedStar 24X and Orchid Prodesigner 2d-s
ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard.
both can give >30fps in DOS' VGA w/ 486dx2/66.
Does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor
type ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)?
any other card recommendation is welcomed too.

also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-)

thanks in advance, folks!

Does anyone know of bigger raster fonts?  I'm using a Mag 15H monitor with
a Diamond SS24X in 1280x1024 mode and would prefer to have larger characters
for the windows heading (practically for everything).  I'm already using the
8514 character sets.

mark

Any idea of the difference between the 15H and the 15F?



Hi all,
could someone please tell me if there are drivers for windows 3.1 for

Mornin' all.  I was wonderin'.....
I got screenpeace (the screensaver, which I think is *very*
good), and I got a problem with it...
There is an option there, "realize colour table", and if it's
switched on, some wallpapers' colours will get *ucked up with
some screensavers (e.g. the "flashlight" one).  If I turn it off,
however, it works well, and it's faster, so I have it off.  All's
nice and well.  However, If I turn it off, then it will be on
again next time I start windows.  All the setting are set in the
win.ini file, and I *do* have "save settings on exit" selected.

also, I tried manually changing the setting in the win.ini file
to "n" (for no-->realize colour table), and started windows.  It
will be fine for that session, but the next session will *again*
turn the option on.

I tried adding a +R (read-only) attribute to my win.ini file, and
it worked, but my bitmap (wallpaper) saver didn't work then.
Actually, it's the same application.  Anywya, it didn't work,
since it must change the setting at the win.ini file.

so anyone out there got any answers/suggesions/comments for me?

thanks, i.a.

Hi, I am using a dtk 386-20Mhz 13Meg memory to run a variety of
programs, and have had problems off and on with lock up,
but now I am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memory
over a period of time (Playmation 24 bit rendered) and it is 
locking up Everytime.  I have an ATI ultra + w/2Meg which I have
tried in each of the video modes, I have excluded the region of
video memory from A000-C800 segments from the use of emm386,
have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to
prevent swapping) and I have REM'd ALL TSR's and utilities in config.syus
and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling
my HP dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv,
no TSR's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still
locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except
3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows
screen, but simply does a full reset immediately).  Just about out
of ideas, anyone out there have any????  Thanks

Whenever I exit Windows, I can't use control-alt DEL to reboot my  
computer, because the system hangs when I do this. I can still reboot  
using the reset key, but I would like to know why this happens..

Hello,

I thought this problem might have something to do with Windows 3.1 SMARTDRV and
a VESA video card...any ideas???

I recently purchased a 486DX-33 machine and am having problems where the 
machine will suddenly freeze or reboot.  This may happen in Windows 3.1 or DOS 
5.0.  Sometimes it is after printing a document, sometimes after using the 
mouse, and sometimes just when I am sitting there.  Twice when it happened, the 
machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps.  I looked in the documentation and 
the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts.  The machine has the 
following configuration and files:

486DX-33
AMI BIOS
5.25 and 3.5 floppies
170 Meg IDE hard drive
256k cache
Microsoft compatible mouse on com1
Citizen GSX-145 on lpt1
NI SuperVGA Monitor with VESA Windows Accelerator Card w/ 1Meg
Two VESA slots
Windows 3.1
DOS 5.0

CONFIG.SYS
==========
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
DOS=HIGH
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
FILES=20
BUFFERS=20
STACKS=9,128

AUTOEXEC.BAT
============
@ECHO OFF
LH C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 1024
PROMPT $p$g
PATH C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;C:\MOUSE
LH C:\MOUSE\MOUSE
SET TEMP=C:\DOS
LH C:\DOS\DOSKEY 


When the machine freezes, I can't use the mouse or keyboard or use Ctrl-Alt-Del 
to reboot.  If any one can give me any help, I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency (memory wise) I 
would appreciate that also.

Hi, anyone have the latest drivers for the Actix Graphics Accelerator Card? 
(32 plus) The one I have (version 1.21) seem to have a lot of problems. 
I believe the latest version is 1.3 and would someone please 
upload it to some ftp site so that I can download it. 

Thanks

Gee, I remember the old 8" FLOPPY disks we used on an S-100 CP/M system
back in high school.  Not to mention those old 24" multi-platter disk 
packs that held about 15MB that went in the big washing machine
drives at the local college I took some programming classes at.
And this was even in the early '80's....

Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see
(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully
scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*
You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.
Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  

I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom
is that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along.  If this
doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly
recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,
place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep
the dust off.

Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice
that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains
or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.

Hi all,

I have a DLL in which I Register a class and create a window of that
class type.  Both calls require a module instance handle, hInstance.

Petzold's 3.1 book says that it is best to use the module instance
handle of the calling program, not the module instance handle of the
DLL (page 934).

I have two questions:

1)  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module?

2)  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of
    the DLL?

Thanks in advance,
Mike

 You can edit that file with a utility that comes with Windows 3.1 called

This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an "OS").  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, "Chicago", debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV.

application came with an Excel macro which can transfer the data.
I need to 'port' it to 1-2-3W.  1-2-3W uses a very different setup
for DDE macros.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to good references?  I have 
downloaded "WW01117:  Windows Dynamic Exchange (DDE)" [the MS
Application Note].  Any books worth getting?

The specifics are:

Server application:  Dionex AI-450 Chromatography Data System
Client application:  1-2-3 for Windows V1.1

Except for the macro, Dionex did not provide any documentation
for DDE.  Also, I am having problems because I am trying to develop
the application on my PC, but to actually get data, you need to be
connect to the instrument.  Any help here would be appreciated, too.

Thanks,

You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God
999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].

But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25" disks.  I hate using 5.25" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around.

Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing.

Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah.

Good luck....

Hi,
I have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and would
like to format it. When trying to format it (*no* low-level
format, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up the
parameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowing
what this does.
The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB.
I tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and not
the nominal 80MB.
Could I use user type 47? However, I don't know the actual
parameters (cylinders, heads,...) Could someone give me them?
And how does FDISK work together with user type 47?
Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM
Thank you,
Thomas

This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a
way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)
to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to
get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!
I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns
one slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,
as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.
My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).

If there is such an expander, does that screw up performance of
everything else?  I'd hate to buy a new motherboard! :-(

HIGHSPEED  ANALOG-DIGITAL PC-BOARD

Hello LAdies and Gentleman !

I am looking for a highspeed A/D PC-Board with a sampling rate above 250 MHz an a
resolution of 8-bit. The sampling rate can be arranged by an interleave mode where
the time equivalent sampling yields 2, 4 or 8 times higher sampling rate than
the A/D-Converter uses in non interleave mode.

The board must content an A/D-Converter similar to Analog Devices AD 9028 or 
AD 9038 or if available a faster on.

If you a PC-Board (16-bit slot, ISA) with this specification or better, please
send me an EMail

I am selling a USR HST 14.4k baud modem with v42bis compression upgrades.
THere is no manual, as it was lost going from one side of the U.S. to the other at some point.  THe modem is setup for max throughput, and it has built in help, but a quick reference guide on the bottom of it, so its use it not difficult by any means.
Any offers?

Howdy,

Sorry if this has been covered before:

One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his
NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work.
Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during 
installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit 
Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted 
with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition 
was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a
32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried 
to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am 
unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I 
kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS 
installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for 
"Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC")...

Thanks in advance,

Paul "Mr. SCSI... NOT!" Fincke




A silly question: I frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them
on several floppy diskettes of the same size and format, but my computer is
only equipped with one 3.5" HD drive and one 5.25" HD drive; can't I do the
copying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk (which is 99.9% full)
using standard MSDOS 5.0 commands? I know
diskcopy a: a:
works but for small selections of files,
xcopy a:*.txt a:
does not!
Maybe I'll have to write my own file copy command in C, but the idea does not
amuse me.
Thanks for your help.

MINE has a 16450 sodered right on the card.  Why would you need the 16550
anyway?  From what I've heard, when you're multitasking, its FIFO buffer keeps
you from loosing data.  Is this right?

A friend who owns a company that builds clones shared with me the fact that
the PCI chipset is NOT expensive -- how about $12?  Many money-hungry-clone
makers, no doubt, will attempt to price the boards high only because it's
new technology.

Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.

Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?

If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  
As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more 
than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in 
the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is 
at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker?  

Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the 
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape.

If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either
the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head
assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may
need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor
is out. 

If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for
repair.

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which
can only address the first 16MBs of system
memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM.

You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE
interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info
sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the
info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:
Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some 
 specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller 
 specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a
 SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2
 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it 
 needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be 
 very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst 
 {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and
 reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between
 SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.

IBM
HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:
[...]
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics 
 currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.

So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES 
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode
it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.
The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its
cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the
Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}

SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while
IDE itself limits the through put.

That's nonsense!!  You can use ISA cards in an EISA-system without problem
and at the same speed as in an ISA system!!

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc, you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed, but it manages.
when booting is finished, plug in your floppy drive, now it will work.

(ok I know this is not very user friendly, maybe you are better off
buying a 486-66 with 300 watt power supply or something like that)

I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!

I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but
my spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:

	1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller
	2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)
	3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)
	4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days 
		(getting happier)
	5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)
	6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days
			(cooling off, the end is in sight)
	7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad
		(VERY unhappy)

Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)
	and have on-site service install it for me.
BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people
only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours
with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$
to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and
I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole 
thing is going back.  
  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me
that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also
the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke
to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything
up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.

I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the
prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support
again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm
beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.
Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is
booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.
Oh well, I feel better now...

Can someone tell me the maximum horizontal and vertical refresh rates of the
NEC 5fgx.(not the 5fge)

Thanks.




* Attention voters:
*
* I had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.
* Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV.
* If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.
* (Actually, check even if you voted after the first day)


Introduction:

	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)
	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)
	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)
	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)
	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)

	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	This document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background:

	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).

	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


Proposed Charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]


How to Vote:

        e-mail ballot to mlevis@lonestar.utsa.edu by April 24

----cut here----------------cut here----------------cut here----------------


Example Ballot #1:

	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes
	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes
	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: no

	(f)       voter's last, first name: Smith, John

	In this example, John Smith favors comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	to be created, and comp.os.os2.programmer to be renamed to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  He also opposes the creation of
	comp.os.os2.setup and comp.os.os2.bugs.  He does not have a view
	on the creation of comp.os.os2.multimedia. 


Example Ballot #2:

	(a) comp.os.os2.programmer.porting: yes
	(b)    comp.os.os2.programmer.misc: yes
	(c)              comp.os.os2.setup: yes
	(d)         comp.os.os2.multimedia: yes
	(e)               comp.os.os2.bugs: yes

	(f)       voter's last, first name: Doe, Jane

	In this example, Jane Doe favors the creation or rename of all
	the proposals.


Voting Rules:

	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most
	  recent vote will be counted.

	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,
	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.

	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will
	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).

	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
	  In other words, a proposal passes if:
	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


Schedule:

	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted
	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the
	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you
	have not voted yet, vote now!

	The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on
	April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.
	The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
	date.


Mass Acknowledgement:

I recently acquired an AST Hot Shot 286 accellerator board for an 8088
sans documentation.  

Does anyone know what the dip switches on the
back of the card do?  

Did it come with software?

Any help or information about the card would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,
Rob

I have WD1007-WA2 ESDI controller with ROM BIOS v.1.1.
It has been working fine until I recently upgraded motherboard to 386-40MHz.
Now, my Maxter drive goes crazy making lots of seeking sound even when the
drive is not accessed.  Of course, with numourous hard disk controller errors.
These symptoms disappear when I switch to non-turbo mode (8 MHz).
I suspect some timing dependent Rom Bios routines. (There's a newer version
2.x) Could anybody help me on this?
By the way, my new mother board has AMI Bios, 128k Cache, 8 MHz bus, and
works fine with my old MFM drives (I had to dig them up). :-(
Also, I will appreciate it very much if somebody send me the phone numbers
(tech support/BBS) for Western Digital.
Many thanks in advance.

Hi!

I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5" drive 
(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives.

I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on
during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I 
try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?
I'm in desperate need of help!!!

Thank you for your time.

I recently purchased the then current Pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed
to NEC 3FGx monitor upgrade). Buy this Pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now
get a bigger HD - 340mb with @256 HD cache. 30 days ago, when I bought this
pkg., it was 245mb with @132K HD cache. This is a great deal although it is
generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' Zeos (CTX) monitor for
$99 more I believe.  Whether you also upgrade to the Diamond Viper video
card is your choice. I stayed with the Diamond Speedstar Pro. Zeos Tech
Support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the 
fastest access. The hardest part about buying a Zeos is the wait till it is
delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! There are quite a
few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with Zeos.

Can get information on many drives, or an
actual person at the end.



Since the net has convinced me not to try FastMicro (if they
were still answering their phones) does anybody have any
opinions on Micron Computer, Inc?  Their 486VL Magnum got an
Editors Choice in the Jan 26th roundup of 486/66s.

Email and I'll sumarize.

I have a 5 1/4" drive as drive A.  How can I make the system boot from
my 3 1/2" B drive?  (Optimally, the computer would be able to boot
from either A or B, checking them in order for a bootable disk.  But
if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that
it can't boot 5 1/4" disks, that's OK.  Also, boot_b won't do the trick
for me.)

Thanks,
  Davebo

Hello,

in the EDN magazine I found a note about the new C&T 82C735
I/O Controller. It support several parallel port protocols,
including
	Fast Centronics
	Microsoft Enhanced Capabilities Protocol (ECP)
	Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP)
The last two handle data rates up to 2Mbytes/sec.

Is there any specification about these protocols available?

	Just wanted to ask a question. I bought a hard disk drive second-hand
the other day, and I opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small
sticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it.
It's socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my
computer already (it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of
the 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk.
I don't know if disk drives for the Apple (or Mac) are different from ones
used in AT clones, so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk
on my AT clone? If not, what did I just purchase? It's a Quantum Prodrive.
It's dated 1988 on the green board. Will I need a controller/add-in card?
All the help is much appreciated. Thanks! :)

Hello,

Can anyone give me their opinion on which system has got the best overall
system performance;

486/66DX2 with ISA-BUS or
486/50DX2 with EISA-BUS

The systems are equal in all other areas.

Thanks in advance

Hi,
VLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz
and 2 cards by 40MHz

there are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLB-Slots.
(s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)

50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design.

Better OSs (OS/2 & iX) are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM,
if you use EISA-Bus.
Has someone experience with VLB ??
I think of SCSI-VLB-Busmaster. The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA
controller, which is unable to reach more than 16MB.

Netters!

I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask
the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper
ones that I want to know more.
The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening
to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's, but
that's not really relevant at the moment.

I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated.
They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2.
The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give
your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not
all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as
a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq.

I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually
about times 1.8.

Mitsumi CRMC     $240
Philips LMS-I    $300
Philips 205      $350
Toshiba ?        $370
Nec CDR-74       $650

Who bought that Trantor that is in the faq? It's extremely cheap and SCSI,
so what's the trick or where can I order it (Holland using MasterCard).

Trantor T128     $200

If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.
I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of
handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser
Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.
It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower
resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent
PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation
processed PS.

The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for
the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.

We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was
accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript
processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also
accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but
Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is
responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our
camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's
demo though).

I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be
surprised if there are several.

Newsgroups: comp.ibm.pc.hardware
Subject: Logitech 2-button mouse pin-out & BIOS routine availability?
Distribution: world
Organization: Purdue University Engineering Computer Network

I have a Logitech 2S-2f (or 2f-2S) 2-button mouse that I want to
interface to a serial port of a different (non-ibm-compatible) system.
The mouse is XT/AT/PS2 compatible, with a DB25 connector.  I tried
to reverse engineer the mouse, but it has a micro-controller inside
it.

If I could get the DB25 pin-out, and perhaps a copy of the BIOS routines
that support it, I could map all this into my target system?

Anyone know where I might get the pin-out or the BIOS routines?
Are the routines published someplace convenient?

Thanks!
Silvio

PS....please send email to me directly!

I am using a 8507 IBM monitor (19" greysale) with a Trident (1MB) card.

The screen looks great (Windows) at 640x480 but total shit at 1024x768.
There are lots of lines and the image is sorta blurry.

Is there anything I can do.  Do you think it is the monitor?  I know
that it is Interlaced at that res but still.

thanks for the help

    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?
    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time
    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time
    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.

About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a
CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I
had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with
CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a
major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver
(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this
until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now
find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled
correctly by the ASW-410 driver.

So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their
FAX number?

Any assistance appreciated.

Regards

BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with
     the rest with the 641.

With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.

Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus.  It actually  slows down your system

Maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus
IDE is

Vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi? whatever intels spec is.
VLBUS it not good for much more than vga cards.

To each his own.  I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you
spent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more
space.

I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.
(obviously exaggerated).

Have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't
because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap....

Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want
to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.

the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.
All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2
drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.  
IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance.
SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.

neither one is better in all cases.

If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa
busmastering cards.

send flames to /dev/null.....

But because of the hor. lines and poping that I do see and hear

I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.
My 2 cents worth:

The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. 
A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference
which way you attach.

Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo
to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think
the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire
connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two
wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate
two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.

LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which
way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,
if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the
board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard
is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't
light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.

If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.

Hope this helps.

I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any
real reviews of them. One of the cards the local stores are pushing is
the Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip,
but I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with 
claims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid
Fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true
if it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it
lags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one 
of them.

Any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via
email, I'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested.

Thanks in advance,
Brian Oppy  (bjoppy@ucdavis.edu)

I don't think FD is a problem.  Since FD is much sloooooooowwwwwwer
than HD, the overhead of double buffering doesn't matter.

Hi!
I got hold of an old Zenith 286 Laptop with model# ZWL-183-45

The hard-disk is dead but the rest seems to work. I took the Zenith apart and found a very strange
disk for wich I now try to replace.

The disk is marked JVC, model JD3824R00-1.
Has anyone any specs. on this disk or suggestion where i can find it or a cheap replacement for it.

Thanks for your help.

Hello all,

You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)
This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with
serials/paral/floppies and 
	- IDE controller "clone" Gw2760-EX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 
	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages
		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.
		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,
		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)

Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected.

Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.
Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount
the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.

I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,
or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, 
depending on setup/jumpers.

Useful suggestions might be:
- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- Do I need some driver to make it work?
- --- " --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?
- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE
is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change
a chip or put a jumper!

Also useful:
- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.
- ftp archives with relevant info.
- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
- any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )

Direct or posted replies are ok.
	Many thanks,
			Cat.

Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the "figure includes a
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers"  This is sloppy people and DUMB.

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list:
SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s
 asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.

SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit
 hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1
 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          
Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
 {Range 0-5MB/s}
>ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)

One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by
people.  Its PROPER meaning is "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of
SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2"
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:
(My comments in {})

PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,
{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."
{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}
To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE..."
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE..."

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers 
are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed
degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

Okay, here is my configuration:

80486-33 Gateway 433C Micronics ISA
12MB RAM 
WD212MB IDE HD ( drive C: )
ST3144A 125MB IDE HD ( drive D: )
Adaptec SCSI 1542B controller, with SCSI BIOS enabled
Seagate ST296N 80MB SCSI drive

Alrighty, when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message, but it says
something like:

"Drive C: installed"
"Drive D: installed"
"ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed!"

And I can't get to the Seagate drive.

I go into PhoenixBIOS setup, remove the entry for drive D:, and BOOM, I can
access the Seagate.  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate
at the same time?  I have ASPI4DOS.SYS, but it just hangs the system.

Windows NT already supports SCSI, a variety of adapters, for disk,

That figure (1/4") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor
(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).

>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these
"imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

Well, it all depends on the motherboard implimentation.

I'm sure someone will make a vlb motherboard that takes 1x9

I have a new MR535 Mitsubishi hard drive (RLL or MFM) that has been

J1 SW1 with 6 switches and SW2 has 8 switches.  SW2 is the one that 
selects the drive number.  If you have info on this drive, or know 
a number I can call to configure it, please, please let me know by

Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II

(also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format
5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5"HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with
many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken
MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25" disks onto 3.5" disks or vice

game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program
named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will
also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II
or FDFormat installed....  Some disks that won't DISKCOPY
properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format...
At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS

14.4 Modem that uses the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem.

What's the word on the chipset?  Is this a ROM bug specific 
to a specific brand using the Rockwell, or is it the Rockwell
chipset itself?  And, if it is the Rockwell chipset, what 
are the chances that if I buy one of these modems (using the
Rockwell chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a ROM
change will fix/compensate for the bug?

Please send responses via email...

  The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode,
which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800
does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should
be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s),
since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell
for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with
the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.
Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using
standard palette.

  BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs
vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to
take it myself).

>Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?

  I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA
chip it uses though.

  Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though, the Orchid I got
for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as 
documentation, and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller 
card (or maybe it's my motherboard, an A.I.R. 486 VLB)

Greetings,

        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info, 
please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),
and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.

        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big
case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom
reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:
1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?
2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I
have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?
3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? 
I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?
What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?
Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if
I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- 
quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle
than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.

Any input is welcome.

Thank you.

Peter Liu

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the
menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in
PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called. 

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred
them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)
or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).

Facts:
=====
- A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered
down for three months.
- From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive.
- Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a
- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and 
pronounced the disk drive unusable.

My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).
When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.

I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.

Install will proceed "successfully", but when I try to boot the server, it
reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.

Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one
disk drive (or at least one large single unit). 

Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready
errors.

Questions:
=========
The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen
SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II
(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what
is causing my serialisation error?
2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of
which has failed?
3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?
4. What else can cause a serialisation error?
5. What happens if the keycard fails?
6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments
and guides.

Thanks for your time.

Apology:
=======
I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm
dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting
my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system
before. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting. Please
feel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post
this.

>How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?

By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)

Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use
the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system
try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or 
crash.(I forget)

Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are
16-bit.

The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.

I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.

In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.

I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA.
I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.

I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the
same DMA channel.

Thanks.

 Computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to
 leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're 
 putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.
  Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.
 You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,
 etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save
 a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't
 look like much when it come time to fix your computer.

no argument on going direct to National (see my previous post on this topic),
but some info regarding what you said above.  I don't know about the 8250 or

Hi!

I think VGA-Copy can do what you need. 
If you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4"), turn on
the "modify" switch of vga-copy.
When you boot using this diskette, a message appears:

This is no system disk, you can
1) replace disk with another,
2) boot from Harddisk or
3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:)
Type your choice:

When you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: .
Seems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks
in 3.5" format was no problem for a friend of mine (I have only a 3.5" a: drive)

Hope that helps
Robert

P.S.: VGA-Copy is shareware, so it's easy to get. Newest Version seems to be 5.0 .

80486DX without the mathematical coprocessor (FPU).

Actually, the 80486 you described above is 80486DX.
(There is no separate 80486 nor 80386, either).

This is for Intel processors. Does anyone have a complete
list with Cyrix and Ibm products?

The F550iW is optimized for Windows.  It powers down when the screen
blanker appears, it powers down with you turn your computer off, and it
meets all of the Swedish standards.  It's also protected against  EMI from
adjacent monitors. 

Personally, I think the F550i is more bang for the buck right now.



I need to know the Pins to connect to make a loopback connector for a serial
port so I can build one.  The loopback connector is used to test the 
serial port.

Thanks for any help.

I read an article about the benefits of a VLB motherboard. It said that a 
true VLB board supports bus mastering, otherwise it is just as good as an ISA
motherboard.

Doesn't all VLB motherboard support bus mastering? I just bought a 486-33 VLB
and the tech manual does not explicitly state the words "local bus mastering"
but it said it "supports bus master and slave modes". Are these terms
synonymous?

Thanks.

PS. - please reply by e-mail as I don't read this newgroup often.

Anyone who knows this answer off-hand, please answer me by e-mail

There is a pair of jumpers on one side, and a set of 3 or 4 on the
other end.  One is labeled, sync , and one CD, and E0 E1 E2.  

Whhich do I need to short, or disconnect to get drive to operate

Keith,

I had a problem getting 256 colors (I was stuck with 16) even though
the flex-stuff said I was at 1024-256.  I solved it by entering
the 'advanced' window on the flex program pannel and changing the
'color palette'.  Sorry for the vaugeness, I hope it helps some.

BTW, I have a GW2000-66V and 1M ATI GUP.

If you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most

system without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (I'm
talking about completely removing the cover - not just leaving the slots
uncovered.) HOWEVER, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
is RF sheilding. Operating a system without the full cover may create
problems with other equipment such as your neighbor's TV or Ham radio

 SuperMac just announced a new line of PC accelerated cards that do 1024x768 in
24bit color.  They start at $999 retail.  I don't think your wait will be very long.

I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install 
COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which 
write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call 
fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put 
"device=pf.sys" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS 
tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and 
such also if that is of any value to you.

I am trying to put together a new PC with VESA Local Bus.  I would like
to get VLB cards for Video and SCSI but I have heard of a problem with
bus mastering controllers on VLB.  Something to the effect that they will
actually slow down a system.  Anyone heard of this problem?

Specifically, I am interested in the Ultrastor 34F VLB SCSI controller.
Before I shell out the bucks for this thing I would like to get the
straight scoop from someone who knows.  Does anyone have this controller?
Any problems with it?

I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that
when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan
monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections.  For this reason, I use the
"factory defaults" for position/size on the ATI card
and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)
at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan
monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is "detected".

I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU 
cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough 
to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins
on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up
pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU
cooler back on.  So far so good.

Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of
the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its
socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?

This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to
1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble
setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,
just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications
are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA
they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).
Every new chip set confuses them.

I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and
it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to
fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If
you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file
P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the
P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,
you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right
combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy
of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT
file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices
should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.
You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of
the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,
too.)

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my
knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the
Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the
numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing
with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the
8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use
benchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,
etc.

I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and
the results of anything else in the universe on these things.

Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has
hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's
use of a hardwired "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then
sat on a tack" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in
real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "Bart
Simpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of the
most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a
screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a
second time in a row.  (We call it the "Bart Simpson optimization"
because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he
could right "I will not cheat on benchmarks" a hundred times and be
done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)

We don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.  There
used to be a lawyer in Montana who didn't, but he died.

Have you checked: 1/ The setting of drive A: to 1.44 M floppy.

I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says
the board is a "391 WB/H."  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine
also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether
the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers
are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.

	Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of.
My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays "Parity Error --
System Halted" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error
Checking to "disabled" or "enabled" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).
Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).

	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the
SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all
worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).

	I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them
in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.

	My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/
parallel/game-port I/O card, or to the motherboard (God forbid).

	CAN ANYONE HELP?

Thanks, Peace,

I own an 8088 640K clone which does all I want except run 1 game I want
to buy.  The game says it requires a 80286 with 640K.  Game tech. support
says game will run on 8088 but uses a some digitized graphics which would
make it run really *slow* (it's a card game - Hoyles Classic Card Games,
digitized graphics are photos artwork of game fictional card players).

What can I do to speed up how this game would run, short of an 80286
motherboard upgrade.  Co-processor?  Accelerator card mimicking 80286?
My 8088 can run at 10 Mhz.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I need to buy a SCSI controler for my 486 machine to use with a quantum  
425F harddrive. I know that adaptec is good, but they are kind of

can use with this drive. I plan to use Windows and later on OS 2.1 when it  
comes out. Any reccomendations appreciated.

I received a Kaypro 286i computer (DOS) without a manual that 
describes the jumpers on the motherboard.  It came with
640KB and I up'd it to 1MB.  But the computer or setup does not
recognize the extra 384K. 

Does anyone know if this computer is capable of greater than 640K
on the main board and what jumpers are required to expand it to 1MB?

Some specs:
	Kaypro main board assy number 81-621
	Phoenix BIOS v1.51 1985

Thanks in advance,

Hi. I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive, and was wondering what  
experience people have with the drives from Iomega, PLI, MASS MicroSystems,  
or Procom. These seem to be the main drives on the market. Any advice?

Also, I heard about some article in MacWorld (Sep '92, I think) about  
Flopticals. Could someone post a summary, if they have it?

Thanks in advance. (Reply by post or email, whichever you prefer.)

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

Please email and or post any leads....

Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for
$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were
intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining
5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.

Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.
Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I
then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me
another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem.

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send
me a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.

I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these
facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data
recovery.)

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still
covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. 

I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La
Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.
But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent
a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)

What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any
other products from La Cie in the future.

Bill Krauthammer
f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu

PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service
has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like
that. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and
I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.





Hi folks,

	what exactly is the maximum memory I can put in
a Quadra 700. My manual says 20MB (with 4 x 4MB SIMMs), 
but MacWarehouse and the like advertise 16MB SIMMs to
give it a total of 68MB. Who's wrong? Has anybody got
68MB?


Thanks,

Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to
this newsgroup.  The "test" was the following command:

>Plot3D[((-2*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-5000)^2+(y-8000)^2+
>81000000)^1.5))+((-3*9000)/(2*3.1416*((x-10000)^2+
>(y-1000)^2+81000000)^1.5))+((4*2000)/(2*3.1416*
>((x-7000)^2+(y-10000)^2+4000000)^1.5)),
>{x,-5500,19500},{y,-5500,19500},PlotPoints->50]


I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on
various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and
workstations.  The results are posted below:

Funny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated.
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow. 

Basically, though, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data.  It
seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up.  

Well, if you have any questions or if I forgot something, just drop me
a line at "cmmiller@iastate.edu".

The screws are Torx screws and the tool isn't to hard to find. It's a

No it is not a good idea to take that fan out.  Why because it will
cause stuff to over heat.  Internal hard drives, motherboard...You name
it and this can cause damage.  I've known people to have hard drive
failures because of fans that didn't work right....

Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to
Apple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's
160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does
not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into
the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.

Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??

The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming
that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);


Macintosh LC to VGA
 
The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA
monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to
16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported
to 256 colors.
 
Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level
          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work
          with the Macintosh LC.
 
To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable
from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the
pinout description for the adapter cable:
 
Macintosh LC        VGA
Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name
---------------     ----    -----------
1                   6       Red ground
2                   1       Red video signal
5                   2       Green video signal
6                   7       Green ground
9                   3       Blue video signal
13                  8       Blue ground
15                  13      /HSYNC
12                  14      /VSYNC
14                  10      HSYNC ground
7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together
 
VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC
video connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which
results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA
monitor.

    Nope. The Apple 16" monitor does not support multiple resolutions.
It is not a multi-synching monitor.

It must be... ...I type it with my left hand.  Personally, I would have
a real problem with my keyboard opened up like that, because I tend to
share some keys with both hands, particularly if I'm doing something else
with one hand (like using the cursor keys, mouse, or glass of Jolt).

Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a "bad"
experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in
a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was
told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return
the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for
returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.

Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were
ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me "Why we never
received your old chips."  I then explained I the procedure that I had
followed to return them, to which the person replied "You mean you sent them
US Mail?" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly
what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were
absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted
to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to
TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)
Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them
to "make it right."

I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking
them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously
appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with
the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of
knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths
to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never
buy another product from them again.

(There - had to get that off my chest!)

Tell that to the Japanese, their local market is neatly protected by
the Japanese government. Its one very tough nut to crack. In fact
the only current way to break into it, is to do it with a Japanese
company as a partner in the venture.

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo
properly?

When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've
had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or
SCSI etc. 

(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't
want to slide out any more).

I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25"
mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First
there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't
figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the
bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?

Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are
a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.

Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to
work and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was
troublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on
the MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on
agian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.

The problem is that My Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will not
connect to my PowerBook 160. The Cable on the Scanner will not fit into
the SCSI port on the PowerBook.

I then got a cable assembled to adapt the original cable to fit the SCSI
port. This, however, turned the computer into SCSI mode and treated it
as a hard disk.

I have asked an engineer in London to assembled a new cable. The idiot,
out of sheer laziness has taken 14 weeks and has yet to solve the
problem. 

I am aware that Caere Co. in the US have a solution.

Do you know of a cable that will solve this problem. Please help me if

I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the
price of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek
reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess
is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price
structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.

Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for
mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new
machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my
IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me
to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel
betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next
week (heh).

Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait
until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and
then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but
you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the
computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous
state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them
again (grin).

Hi!

   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has
two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound
digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)

   Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it
seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)

   Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these
things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you
from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs
that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?

   Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you
think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would
like to spend under $140, if possible.

   Please reply through mail; I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.
If there's interest, I can post a summary of replies.

Thanks a lot!

You should be able to pick up an ADB cable at any computer wiring store...
I'd give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary, but a: I'm
in Victoria (B.C., Canada) and b: I don't think an address in Calgary would
help you too much....basically however I just phoned them up, and they
charged me approx. $15 cnd for a custom made ADB extension cable for my mouse.

Hope this helps...

I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is
supposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data
transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is
available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two
mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since
I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The
CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,
which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the
CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly
lower price with two free CDs.

The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I
think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the
three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple
catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo
cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of
which are pretty good.

The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and
a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around
$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible
before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of
the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's
unless you buy it in a bundle.

Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the
Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's
compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's
speed and performance. 

BTW, the models of the drives are:

Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)

CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it
is also something like with 3401)

NEC:  CDR-74


I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems
whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am
pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.

Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as
the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,
my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is
just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the
enormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has
three Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and
lives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.

Of course its possible, I get 1024x768 on my Centris 650. All you need is

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just
releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the
original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
easier cleaning.

If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the
new ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at
the guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent
with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw
heads.

Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped
myself and a few others:

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't
rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). 
Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache?

I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some
operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses?

Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above.

Hello all.
	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.
	I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that
can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an
old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-
back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the
Micron Xceed) ?
	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards
the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)
but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?

Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.

I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order
companys that sell monitors or cards.

Thanks in advance

I work in a campus bookstore and we had the opportunity to demo the Color

 educational discount of course!).  Note also that it comes with Ofoto
software
which is sufficient for our needs.

I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned
me not to use US mail.  I did (although I did insure the shipment), and 
apparently Techworks got it.

My minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
different people.  I ordered DUO memory, thinking I got their "best" price
because of my employeer.  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering
developers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,
and was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited
my card for about 16% of the purchase price.   I like techworks quality
and installation instructions (and they include powerbook tools), but 
for out-of-CA purchases (no sales tax) chip merchant seems to be a bit less.

  I've got a Racet 5.25" MO Drive with a Ricoh RO-5030E mechanism with the
new ROMs... The thing is, I have a new TOSOH Optical Disk 512/bytes per
sector cart for the thing that refuses to mount or be formatted... all the
carts that I have for the drive that work are Racet Certified Media
512k/sector carts... All I can think of is that this TOSOH cart uses some
kind of incompatible low level format... anyone know what software will
allow this to be formatted on this drive? or a new DIP setting for the
mechanism? I've tried just about every combination of drivers and custom
formatting programs I can find with no luck... any ideas?

In the bottom drawer I just found an old A+ mouse with a DB-9 (9-pin) plug.
I assume that it belonged to a deceased Plus or something. 

Could any simple modification turn it into a proper ADB mouse?

Reply by mail, preferably.

It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some
purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve).


Otherwise the other possibilities would be:

1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial
port on mac, collect data with some communications program.

2) Buy an A/D chip from Analog devices, Burr-Brown, etc, connect to
a parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition
(nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-)

3) Get a board from National Instruments, Data Translation, Omega,
etal.  The finest solution, but possibly the most costly.



To the original poster:  if the signal is too large, why not
use a voltage divider? Two resistors, cost very cheap...

A quick query for Powerbook gurus:
Tom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options
mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180
batteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (M5545/A), a 2.8 amp hour one,
(M5545/B) and a 2.9 amp hour one (M5545/C). Anyone out there
know how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at my
battery and there is no obvious exterior indication. I contacted
Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he
didn't know either. Anyone out there know the answer?
	Thanks!

of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser 
used.  ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
has been rewritten (inside the ROM) to take advantage of the 68040
addressing modes.  commands that do fills should be slightly faster
since the new instructions fetch 2 bytes at a time versus one.

The service notice on the 13" hi-res monitors expired 3/23/93 after this  
date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix (replacement  
of the hi-voltage capacitor). All you folks that have been putting up with  
intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
out on the freebie. It was in force for a year. If you got it free after  
3/23, you got a deal...

Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.

I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service
lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.

Okay, I don't use it very much, but I would like for it to keep working
correctly, at least as long as Apple continues to make System software
that will run on it, if slowly :-)

Here is the problem:  When the screen is tilted too far back, vertical
lines appear on the screen.  They are every 10 pixels or so, and seem
to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus.
It looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection
between the screen and the rest of the computer.

I am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer,
or taking this one to the shop.  I would also like to not have
to buy one of Larry Pina's books.  I like Larry, but I'm not sure
I feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual
for it.

On a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to?

The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than
Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.

>    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only
>(can't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133), so your best bet

That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire
(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240
all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly
remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all
of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered
DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used
with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.

My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:

(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add
    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going
    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.
    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it
    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).

(2) On the Mac side, you will need:
    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).
    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).
    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be
      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).
    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the
      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is
      self-terminated or not.
    - configure MacTCP to use "Ethernet".

(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:
    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.
    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.
      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the
      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).
    - get a 25ohm terminator.

Your two-machine network will look like this:

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.
It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with
a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you
very much).
 
well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .

The magnet trick will work. Be careful when you apply the white tape to the
rubber carriage roller, it tells the scanner where the edge is and it can come

It should not matter for the hard drive or the Mac.  Well, as long as it

According to the (seen several times) postings from Dale Adams of Apple
Computer, both the 610 and the 650 require 80ns SIMMS - NOT 60 ns.  Only
the Centris 800 requires 60 ns SIMMs.

  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"
with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're

Hi there,


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers.

On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of
32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?
On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capable
of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that
both machines have 16-bit color capability.
Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?
From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
16-bit color, is that correct?

Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they
seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?


Thanks for your help!

I thnik i'll be able to pick up  a piar of Mac 512K's for nothing, but
their power supplies are dead.  Anyone know where I can pick up a pair
of refurbished PS's for cheap (preferably mail order).
Yes, I do have uses planned fior them.  One will be sold to a friend who
just needs a terminal to connect via modem to his e-mail account.
The other will be used by me as a net client to run my downloads and/or
printing.
  
Also, what is the latest system software usable with these suckers?

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen - it freezes.

I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
startup.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured
twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time.

Anyone out there with these same problems?

Macintosh IIsi, 3/40, 80ns.
Clock-upgraded IIsi works well at 25MHZ, however, does not work with
Nubus adaptor and 1400k disk even though it can read/write 800k disk
at32MHz. Interestingly, upgraded IIsi overcomes basically the fighting
between the Vedio and the System so that CPU never be reduced below 8 no

use the virtual memory of system 7.

Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:
djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
 
I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have
two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one
screen.
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within
driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction.
 
Details:
 
Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:
---------------------------------------------------
 
**SOLD**
 
Sony 1304 14" color monitor:
----------------------------
What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,
Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).
It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,
and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.
 
Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not
including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable.
 
 
RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13"
monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode
(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a
RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg
SIMMS).
 
Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking
**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and
packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer"
for these items.
 
------------
 
Cheers.

I've been looking into getting a portable Mac to do some work and I've
had my eye on the PB 100. Lately, I've been seeing people with the old
portables, and they're selling for $300 LESS that the PB 100s. What I
want to know is: what are the differences between them? All I know is
that the Portable is heavier, but the PB100 doesn't have an internal
drive. Here's what I NEED to know:

Does the portable support Appletalk/network connections?
What's the CPU inside a Portable? (68000?)
DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM 7?????????
What's the maximum memory capacity of the Portable? Can you still get
	RAM (meaning: does it use special SIMMS?)
What kind of internal HD does it use?
Does the Portable have a better screen?

						THANX in advance.

060 fastest, then Pentium, with the first versions of the PowerPC
somewhere in the vicinity.

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed.
Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory
system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If
you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory
every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but
it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.

And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the 68030.

Here is the story:
I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an
Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh
I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected
to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.

Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,
and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do
the trick.

Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that
there aren't going to be any.

Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers
to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...

thanks in advance.

Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S?

I have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16" mode, the
picture won't
go very big. I end up with about 1" gap either side, and .5" top &
bottom. I suspect
an internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it?

Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or
off the main
raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the
screen is blanked.
This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens
I have
used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not
visible, the
real image virtually disappears!

The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too
much!

Oh, and I am using a RasterOps 24XLi card.

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:
 
Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)
 
I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.
 
My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

Not a good idea to compare processor power. Doesn't make sense for real
world applications. At least not for totally different lines of processors.

At least for x86 systems doubling the clock speed increases performance
by about 70% .

Be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker.
Make sure that all the power cords are in the same strip.  If you don't you
take a chance of having a very bad audio buzz.  This is caused be a "ground loop" and the only way of getting rid of this loud buzz is to make sure that you 
have a common ground.                                
Make sure that all the power cords are going in to the same strip or off the 
same outlet.  This will assure you of a common ground.

How do you calculate that figure? I'd assume even in personal computers
the board designers would use bank switching to (optimistically) 
quadruple the access speed  or am I missing something here?

   My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it.
It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad
or video card is bad.
   I checked my monitor, it works fine with other Mac.
   I checked my video card, it's also fine.
   I replaced all the RAMs, it still didn't give me right answer.
   Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard.

   I don't know hardware architecture of the Macintosh.

   Can anyone tell me what's the problem ????

   It's a Mac IIcx.

Mac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and
mix the output (the SE/30 for instance) while others play in
stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while
some are "truly" mono (like the LC)

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is
guaranteed to be heard, while the right channel isn't. Some
send data to both, some only send data to the left channel
(the first is preferrable, of course)

Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based
Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and
the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,
NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.

Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except
perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC
slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC
accelerators.

One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will
need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with
Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.

Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs
will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC
and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in
existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking
prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen
much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.

First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed
CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.
This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled
for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which
I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do
this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as
standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where
Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup
is in order.

By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,
Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor
front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.
Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all
the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent
right now.

Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market
position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially
if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it
might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome
battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not
guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of
several.

I have finally decided to update my SE :-)).
I am planning on buying a Centris 610-8/230 CD.
Now, what monitor should I get? Here are a few
guidelines:
	My wife uses PageMaker occasionally, I use Excel sometimes
	and I do alot of Telecommuting from home to work. We both
	do Word processing. Greater than 14 inches.

I have looked at the Radius Color Pivot. This can be bought for
under $1000. I have heard good things about the E-Machines T-16,
the older model not the new T-16 II. How about the Super Mac 17T?
These both can be had for a little over $1000. Any others??

   I seem to be having some trouble with this...

   I can get the mac to go to sleep, but I can't make seem to 
make it wake up with SetWUTime().  I am aware of the error in
the header files and IM VI.  I am setting the WU time to be
about two minutes, then putting the mac to sleep, but it doesn't
wakeup at the appointed time....

   Does it require a call to SystemTask in order to make sure that
everything is setup?

    If you mean in a "newer, more powerful" Mac system then the answer
is no. Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the 72-pin SIMMs and
no longer use the 30-pin SIMMs.

    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is
no "option" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:
there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).
And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one
of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't
be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.
It's not an "option."
    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s
thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.

A question in general about displaying NTSC through a Mac.

If I understand correctly, the Video Spigot can display NTSC
in a small window as well as capture the data in Quicktime
format.

However, if I want to use a larger window, what are my options?
Perhaps I misunderstood the Video Spigot review...  

Also, I am not interested in Quicktime.  I would merely like to
use my Mac as a television from time to time.  I have a nice
Sony 1430 monitor, and I would like to use it as a second TV
when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular TV.  

Perhaps some of the video cards for the Mac accept NTSC input?
I have a IIsi, and I am willing to buy a NuBus adapter.

Thanks in advance for any help,

I've got two CD300's... The first one i ordered Jan 15, and I received it Feb. 20.
The second one I ordered Jan 20th, and I just got it April 2nd or so. Anyway, they
both come with 10 misc. CDROMs... Things like a "Intro to Nautilis", a sample CD
of Kodak pictures, "From Alice to Ocean" (a story of a woman who treked across
Austrailia), 3 discs from apple, a games disc, an applications disc, and a "titles"
disc (haven't checked most of these out yet). Also some "Cinderella" thing for kids,
a disc of Mozart something-or-others, etc. etc. etc. If someone's super interested,
I'll make a list of the exact titles and post them. They are all in the category of
"Interesting, but probably fairly useless...". It was rumored that the earliest 
units shipped with SOME encyclocpedia (it may have), but neither of my drives had
that.

I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I
originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This
was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.

Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is
powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given
the "no disk to boot from" icon.  However, upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  
Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power
off and on always works.

This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed?

I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to 
"come up to speed" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the HD?

Thanks!

Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to
make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values
into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was
because
of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by
scanning
this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on
some machines).

When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to
generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had
once
documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant "I
want to
play a mono sound" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted
the
documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers
of
sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you
want
to make stereo sound.

Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from
the
IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game
writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.

Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output
hardware,
and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase
works.
On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase
gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra
700/900/950
at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel
only.
Both are technically correct interpretations of the original
specification,
but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.

If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono
sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the
underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left
channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their
games will only come out the left on some games.

The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound
on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.
It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of
the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which
are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what
machine
you have.

Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:
>Lemmings
>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
>Glider 4.0
>OIDS
and also
Hellcats,
Super Tetris
Oxyd
(and many more, these are just what I've tested)

Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.


Other games you list:
>Armor Alley
>Spectre
>Spaceward Ho!
and also
PGA Tour Golf
Civilization
(and more, these are again only from personal experience)

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.

The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!
Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do,
but I'm going say it anyway.
Stop cheating on sound!
Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period
is about to end.
The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon, so use it.

In conclusion:
To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.
To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send
sound
to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of
automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all
hardware.


Have fun.

Disclaimer number 1:
I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.
So don't write me with sound questions.

Disclaimer number 2:
If it says up above that I wrote anything like "the grace period is about
to end" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not

I've recently ordered a Centris 650 and need to decide on which modem to
buy.  I'm pretty sure I want to get a fax/data modem that can run at 14.4k,
but is it worth it?  I'll primarily only be 'conversing' over CompuServe or
some other link to the Internet, but I'm not sure if those systems can
supply ME with data at 14.4k.  Another question I have is in some of the
modem lingo out there.  I understand baud rates, but what does V3.4 and
V3.4bis mean?  I could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem
for around $300 would be, and why it would be a good choice.

Hello all,

If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and
motherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.  I have tried some mail
order places and some local stores.  Both groups would prefer that I part
with over $1000 to get just the case.  In my eyes this seems about $600-$700
to much.  Any comments?  I currently own the guts of a 950.

Please email me or post to this group w/ info,

Thanks in advance,

Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus.  I believe it is
the best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800
upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????
  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal
clock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up
SCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.
Check it out.

I think you are suffering from some alignment or color
table or <whatever> problems, if a Color Classic is as fast
as a Quadra rendering to screen.

What screen card you use does of course matter much (built-in
video is almost always faster than NuBus)

Or you measured "scroll entire screen" where the Color Classic
had a VRAM 10" screen in 4-bit color and the Quadra had a
21" 24-bit screen on NuBus :-)

Jeff,
  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony
CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed
specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video
capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it
takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is
about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of
comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half
a year and I love it.  
Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a
Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons
why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only
complaint was that they did not always return my calls.  
I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's
(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.

1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.
 My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern
one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know
of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20
buit have no idea if they will work)
 
2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a
jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know
of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1
 
all help and advice appriciated.

I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).
It is a 3.5" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest
drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the 
drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures
are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of
performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC
and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the 
differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according
to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.
I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak
including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI
and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands
are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 
105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges
are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.
Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli
drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more
reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to 
getting my hands on one.

wouldn't completely boot off the internal HD. I get the "happy mac", then it
disappears, only to reappear and repeat the cycle continuously. I never even

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  
trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  
and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  
to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  
place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  
that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  
wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  
could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   
It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  
wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  
correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  
my NeXT that way.

Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  
problem, and at pretty high speeds too.

I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  
pretty standard.

Hope this helps,
-Avery

Is this being done with the motherboard's SCSI interface? If this is possible
then a bit of experimenting with just plain old clock oscillators may be
in order. Give us some more details please.

Is anyone out there using a greyscale handscanner. I'm thinking about
buying one. Is the inexpensive Logitech pretty good. I don't need
super high quality scans- but want it to be worth the $$$$.

Thanks in advance-

Hi all,

I just got a La Cie 240 meg external hard drive.  Speed tests show that it's
substantially faster that my internal 105 meg Quantum HD.  Supposedly the 105
and the 240 (both LPS drives) are roughly rated the same speed.  Why such a 
large difference?

Marc.

Hi there,

when I run Disk First Aid on my external hard drive (Quantum LPS 240) I get the followinf
message: Error -535: Missing thread record (TarID=31015; TarBlock 416)
Disk First Aid is not able to fix this problem, Norton Utils doesn't find it at all.
When I use Norton Disk editor to look at TarBlock 416 I can read something like "DirReservedArea"

My question: How can I get rid of this error (without reformatting of course)

I've seen a control panel made for this. I don't remember the name, where I

  Try Goldstar. They make them, and they are available immediately in Mac
configurations. I ordered a pair from Computerland (8 meg variety) and
they work like a charm. I've had them for two weeks.

I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner.  It came with scanning/editing
software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al.  The
scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly
accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art
settings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I
frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image
in the note.  Hope this helps!

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.

Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.
It's small enough that I will attach it.

I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB
cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to
40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective
difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better.  I do not have an FPU.

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.

If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to
see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called
"Performance Rating" numbers by themselves are of no interest. 

Cheers.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)
=====================================================================

I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?

1. Free options
	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.
	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will
	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86
	is listed below.

	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was
	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.
	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,
	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).
	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?

3. What is XFree86?

   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with
   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and
   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:

    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,
       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of
       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield
       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.
    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately
       20% faster than X386 1.2.
    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,
       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from
       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.
    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.
       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers.
    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is
       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the
       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions.
    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.
    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included.

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2
   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):

    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 
       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).
    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two
       headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).
    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to
       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for
       more information.)
    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation).
    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more 
       information).
    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.
    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file).

       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details.

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the
   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.

4. What OSs are supported?

    XFree86 supports:
	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2
	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC
	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2
	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1

	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active
	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.

	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to
	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. What video hardware is supported?

   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:

	Tseng ET4000
	Tseng ET3000
	Paradise PVGA1
	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of
		the PVGA1, and use its driver)
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000
	ATI 18800, 28800

	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in
	256 color mode.

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the
	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86
	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how
	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such
	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree86 releases.

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,
	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not
	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.
	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.

	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It
	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested
	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86
	working fine on them.

6. What about accelerated boards?

	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards
	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).

	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact
	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.

	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>
	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.

7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-
	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled
	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code
	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).
	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer
	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,
	but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?

	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run
	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.
	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending
	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will
	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound.

9. Where can I get source for XFree86?

	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22
	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:
		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)
		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)
	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?

	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries
			under /XFree86/SVR4
		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86
		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/ISC
		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86
		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries
			under /pub/linux/packages/X11
		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries
			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86
		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries
			under /i386

	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were
	made when building the distribution.

IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?

11. Installation directories

	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include
	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is
	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed
	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.

12. Configuration files

	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup.
	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.
	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and
	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is
	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on
	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated
	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the
	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database.

	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file 
	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use
	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and
	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future.

14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.

V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?

	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).

15. SVR4
	Why won't my xterm run properly?

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define
	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. SVR3

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.

17. 386BSD

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.

	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:

	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2

18. Linux

	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc
	jump libraries installed.

	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to
	run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files
	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the
	-pn argument to X386.

	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major
	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not
	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but
	startx won't.

	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with
	a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &".

	For more detailed information, please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.

19. Mach

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.

VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?

	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is
	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.

VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?

20. BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a
	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),
	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a

21. ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"
	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"
	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi"
		CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings"
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:
		ANSICCOPTIONS=
	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death
	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

XFree86 Contact Information

    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86
    Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:

	The original "gang of four":
		David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au>
		Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu>
		Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu>
		David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com>

	Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems:
		Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach]
		Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD]
		Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux]

No. This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3.x as shipped with SunOS.
It is not relevant for MIT R5. MIT R5 should compile without problems.

Hi,

I am about to write an application in X/Motif that will require the
embedding of a pseudo tty. So, before I re-invent the wheel, has anyone
written/gotten a motif widget that does the job ? Otherwise, I would
appreciate any pointers to make such a beast.

My environment is X11R4/Motif 1.1 and X11R5/Motif 1.2 (if this helps).


Thanks in advance.

Email : arthur@mailhost.scs.com.sg




I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely
MicroSoft Project ). The original system ran on the PC. Now it needs to
be expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application. The
current proposal is to use DESQview/X as a display server for the
application.

I would like to know your experiences with using DESQview/X to run an
application on a PC and displaying on a SPARCstation. I've heard that
the network traffic is slow.

Replies only by e-mail please.

Thanks, in advance.

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it
is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this
bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy,
and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

Archive-name: x-faq/part2
Last-modified: 1993/04/04

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application?

	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window 
or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. 
The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr 
client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:
		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &
and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current
display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an
undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the 
command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for 
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]

	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of 
arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.
There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]
is the most recent.
	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders 
XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;
see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.
	A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: 
soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.
	xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available
from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.

	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,
which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps
and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for 
use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive
servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.

	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and
save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.

	Also: 

	Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 
2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net
in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.

	ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-
capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and 
non-PostScript printers.

	Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) 
include session managers or other desktop programs which include "print portion
of screen" or "take a snapshot" options. Some platforms also have tools which 
can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, 
have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals 
have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.

	Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct 
support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package 
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?

	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can 
	- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color 
PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv 
	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.
You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick 
distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?

	This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider 
instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?

	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ 
Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting 
among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, 
gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;
the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.
	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in 
particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.
It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).

	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a
version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are 
later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  
Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; 
see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.

	xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), 
can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, 
GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, 
contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned 
formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on 
it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; 
see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

	The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.
Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available
via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, 
and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.

	The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads
and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image
manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as
contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.

	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar 
to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, 
weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.

	Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential 
interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is 
a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and 
Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, 
xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a
library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.

	ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from 
export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display
images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF
from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.

	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written
to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed
as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on
export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]
xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

	A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool
is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package 
also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92]

Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?

	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar.
	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:
		echo "ESC]2;TEXT^G"
where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,
and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).

	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories:
		alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G'

	The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should 
change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name 
used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the 
icon name.

	Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the
escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.

	Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a ^V.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?

The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file 
ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.

O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control 
sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of 
the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences. [1/93]

Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document
and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a 
compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 
sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was 
published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).

In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?

	In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to 
"stty pass8" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as 
	XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
	XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]

In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:
	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1

        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with 
the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using
`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') 
is Alt-'.

Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?

	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give 
a resource specification like this:
		xterm*geometry: 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. 
But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:
		xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?

	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. 
However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for 
manipulating the selection will help; e.g. 
	% xselection PRIMARY | lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a 
window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties. A version is on export.
	Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be
adapted to do this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?

	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are 
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and 
XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for 
application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most
one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from
the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a 
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.
Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also 
have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could 
set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up 
app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):
	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see 
XtResolvePathname()):

        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the
                application's class name.
        %T      The value of the file "type".  In this case, the
                literal string "app-defaults"
        %C      customization resource (R5 only)
        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")
        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. "ja")
        %t      The territory part of the display's language string
        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string

	Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is 
"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the 
example omits locale-specific lookup.)
	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

	As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above 
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it 
and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to 
search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

	Let's consider another example. This time, let's set 
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working 
directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.
	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

	The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands 
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging 
because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file 
Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and
%S are useless.

	With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization 
resource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application like this:
	myterm -xrm "*customization: -color"

	If one of your pathname specifications had the value
"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution character 
takes on the value of the customization resource.

	The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

	(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in
this batch of default settings.)

	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 
		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

	<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory 
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other 
than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find 
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR 
to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 
compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to "./", a dot followed 
by a slash.

Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources; for example, 
your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line 
	DisplayManager.0.authorize: false 
to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also 
	DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb
where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:
	#!/bin/sh
	#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
	/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap
	/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*
Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a 
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?

	When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login
files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;
or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,
if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your 
.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting
your .xsession file off with "#!/bin/csh". 
	If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:
		#!/bin/sh
		# Reset path:
		PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?

	There are several ways to avoid having to do a "setenv DISPLAY ..."
whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.
	One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It 
includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and
xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.
A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.
	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse
(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from
132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and
$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then 
propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain
		eval `xrlogind`
where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special 
format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to 
recreate the environment variables. [11/90]

	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on 
another host, and you find
		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY 
too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh 
can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be 
		xrsh <HOST> xterm

  #! /bin/sh
  # start an X11 process on another host
  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT
  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>
  # rsh $host -n "setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null"
  #
  # An improved version:
  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)
  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)

Subject:  38)  How can I design my own font?

	One way is to use the "bitmap" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g.
Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate 
them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X 
Journal for more information.
	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained 
a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.
	An easier way is to use the "xfed" client to modify an existing font; a
version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], 
possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce
BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.
	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,
XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in
/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed 
[5/91] in export:/contrib. 
	If you are a MetaFont user you can use "mftobdf" from the SeeTeX
distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution
is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.
	The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,
a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.
	The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font.
	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is
in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?

	After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, 
installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent
(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp 
$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the 
directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably 
leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in 
the path.)
	Sometimes your "xset +fp $dir" command fails with a BadValue error:
		X Error of failed request:BadValue
			(integer parameter out of range for operation)
		Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)

	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The
mention of an "integer parameter" in the message is spurious.)

-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file
   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your
   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. "xset +fp ~/myfonts") and
   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.

-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server
   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file
   "fonts.dir".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're
   running OpenWindows, look for the file "Families.list".  If you can't find
   it, run bldfamily(1).)

-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a
   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for
   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.
   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for
   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work
   for X11Rn.

Subject:  40)  How do I convert a ".snf" font back to ".bdf" font?

	A tool called "snftobdf 1.4" is part of the bdftools package, which is

crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?

	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and 
produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be 
used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can 
understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools 
such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail 
from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]

Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?

	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to
standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file 
contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is 
for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for 
creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers 
which do not use the MIT font scheme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  43)  How do I add ".bdf" fonts to my DECwindows server?

	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the ".pcf" format.
You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc
font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a
performance hit.

Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)
I want to be able to do something like this:
	xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave

	You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the 
same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because 
of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since 
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, 
neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap 
converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a 
resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for 
use in many of its widgets, however.
[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]

However:
	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of 
the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick 
(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of 
image formats as a pixmap.

	The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used 
by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by
AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM 
distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write 
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information
on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on 
the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen 
(anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib/AIcons.]

Subject:  45)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.

	Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \n\ 	
	Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()

which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:

	The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)
delete "old" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which 
contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add "! -type s" to
the find exclusion in the cron job.

Subject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen?

The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens, sorry.

Subject:  50)! How do I get my Sun Type-[45] keyboard fully supported by Xsun?
 
Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the 
appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. The Xsun server as distributed by MIT
doesn't do this but there are two different patches available.
 
The first patch is written by Jonathan Lemon and fixes the Num Lock related 
problems. It is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file
contrib/Xsun-R5.numlock_patch.Z .
 
The second is written by Martin Forssen and fixes the Num Lock and Compose keys
and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for Type-4 and 
Type-5 keyboards. This patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in
contrib/sunkbd1216-0314.tar.Z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.
 
[thanks to Martin Forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se), 8/92]

A set of patches by William Bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups
11/92 to provide support for the Type-5 keyboard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  51)  How do I report bugs in X?

	Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you
with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly 
from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in
mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]

[Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  52)  Why do I get "Warning: Widget class version mismatch"?

	This error, which typically goes on to say, "widget 11004 vs. 
intrinsics 11003" indicates that the header files you included when building 
your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking 
against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.
	However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the 
X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun OW
systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, 
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you
have seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?

	Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's
Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware
that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster 
and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.
	[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A
Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu 
(129.79.254.192) in "pub/webster/NeXT-2.0".]
	Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. 

	However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the
latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file 
xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and 
non-availability of dictionary servers.

Subject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?

	No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not 
"public domain", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X 
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.
	Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?

The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the 
previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility 
across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, 
details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the 
network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the 
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]

The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these versions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  57)! Where can I get X11R5 (source and/or binaries)?

Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape 
and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from 
Software Center, Technology Licensing Office, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, 28 Carleton Street, Room E32-300, Cambridge MA 02142-1324,
phone: 617-258-8330.

You will need about 100Mb of disk space to hold all of Core and 140MB to hold
the Contrib software donated by individuals and companies. 

PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network.

Note that the RELEASE notes are generally available separately in the same
directory; the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a
guide to the distribution.

I don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the Sun User
Group makes X11R5 available on CD-ROM to its members. The 1992.1 disk
has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  I've tagged a
table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested.

SUG CD 1992.1 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM, priced at $50 to SUG
members, including a caddy!

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk
contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,
almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net
postings, priced at only $250.

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.

The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains
a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per
disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a
SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live
within the US or $55 outside.

The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
total of 543MB of material, including:

X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after

Hi,

	Does anyone have any information on joining the X Consortium ? What
are the costs, what are the benefits, who should I contact ? Thanks





Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function "XmuCvtStringToWidget". I
want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect
two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.

MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW

However, when I run the program, I get the message:

Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.

(Just like the manual sez).

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this:

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {
        {
            XtWidgetBaseOffset,
            (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),
            sizeof(CoreWidget)
        }
    };

    XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,
                            parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );


However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widget's "class_intialize" function. HOW? What's
one of those? :-(

If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure
this is a FAQ.

Thanks in advance,

Rik.

PS: What are the header files "CoreP.h" and "IntrinsicsP.h" - should I use
    these or "Core.h" and "Intrinsics.h" (OK I know RTFM:-)

xdm does XGrabServer when it's running in secure mode (so do some
screen-locks).  There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.

You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.

You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts
a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal
handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.

Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory
leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() 
regularly.



Hi,
	I am in the process of making the decision whether I should
write c++ wrappers for motif myself or use Motif++ or Interviews.
Though I have downloaded the tar files, I fail to see any
documentation. I have two questions:
	1) If you have used these or similar c++sy toolkits what has been
your experience?
	2) Where do I find reference books /documentation for them?

any and all input will be greatly appreciated.

Hi,

I just compiled the X11R5 distribution for a Sun3/SunOS4.1.1.  I also
compiled the public domain xview3 (with olwm) distribution.  I have some
old 3rd-party application binaries that are SunView programs.  How do I
get them to work under xview3 and olwm?  (I tried using the OpenWindows
version 2 "svenv" program, but it did not work.)

I do not have news access....that's why I am mailing this directly.  Also,
is there an email alias where my questions can get to comp.windows.x or
comp.windows.open-look?  PLEASE RESPOND TO fwr8bv@fin.af.mil

Thanks,

Look in xfig.  It has two types of spline algorithms and is relatively simple.

	HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF X -- monthly posting

	    Compiled by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)

  More RAM, Faster CPU's, More disk space, Faster Ethernet...  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation.

  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity.

  This "FAQ" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.

  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must
  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
  However, they are outside the scope of this document.

    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    "System Performance Tuning" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the
    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written
    comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any
    other similar books.  --ed.]

Introduction & Administrivia
-----------------------------

  This document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the
  Usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers.
  If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few
  months old (see the "Last-modified" date above) you should probably
  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does
  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can
  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.

  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about
  them and how to access them, please see the "Introduction to the
  news.answers newsgroup" posting in news.answers.

  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document
  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If
  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by
  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the
  command "send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups" in the message body.

-----------------------------
What about the "Other X FAQ"?
-----------------------------

  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
  well written "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" document.
  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance.

  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with
  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:
	"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".
  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).

---------------
Window Managers
---------------

  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this
  point, most respondents have agreed upon "twm" as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager. 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
  is turning off unnecessary things like "zooming" and "opaque move".
  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)
  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.

------------
The X Server
------------

Which Server?
- - - - - - -
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.

  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging.  
         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),
                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law
  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be
  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
  You can expect to get "*very* large speedups in the server" by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
  compilers on the market.

Locking the Server into RAM?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help
  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.

Starting your Server
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my
    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.

  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  

  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works, which I have summarized here:

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of
    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you
    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up.

    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
    being fetched, programs initializing state and "databases" and so
    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this
    initialization is done ("The process has reached a steady state"),
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a "Your Mileage May Vary" situation, as there
  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap
  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
  you are starting, etc.

  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

  I've experimented with:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &

  I've even tried:
	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &
  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
    into a "steady state" before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched. ]

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with
  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

Fonts
- - -
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server.
			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),
			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]

  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13
  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since
  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.

  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):
    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.

About the Resources File
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  One suggestion:

    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true

    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your
    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

    [ The "comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions" FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
    --ed.]

    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,
    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system
    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to
    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name.

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),
		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),
		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits:

    - Easier to maintain / more usable.

    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

  It also has drawbacks:

    - the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference, and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
      application without having to "xrdb" again.

    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!

      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
      processing the resource file.

      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef
      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management.

    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For
      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.

    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
  .Xdefaults file, and to use the "separate resources files" method for
  clients that I seldom use.

Define Your Display Properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In
  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  "<hostname>:0.0", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to "unix:0.0" or ":0.0".  By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]

  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name.

  "I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially."
			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)

  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if
  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]

-------
Clients
-------

  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also
  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock?

  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]

  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In
  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually
  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.

  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try
  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif
  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library.

  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment.

A Better Clock for X
- - - - - - - - - - -

1) xcuckoo
   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.
   Saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar

   Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources.

  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and 
  takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  From the README file distributed with xterm:

  +-----
  |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here
  |
  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
  | ...
  +-----

  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.

  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]

1) Xvt
   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :
   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z

   "...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog! "

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to
   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.

   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For
   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap
   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard
   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.

   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
   brought into memory.

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,
   relative speed of each

Tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets:

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not
    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference
    on a [slower system].

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests?

-------------------------
Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

Pretty Pictures
- - - - - - - -
  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.

  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)

  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

A Quicker Mouse
- - - - - - - -
  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse.  I use "xset m 3 10" in my .xinitrc file,
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.

  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for
  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  

  e.g. (for twm) :
      menu "mouse settings" {
        "Mouse Settings:"			f.title
	"  Very Fast"				! "xset m 7 10 &"
	"  Normal (Fast)"			! "xset m 3 10 &"
	"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"	! "xset m default &"
	"  Glacial"				! "xset m 0 10 &"
      }

Programming Thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
    things you can do.  Some that stick out:

    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.

    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.

    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.
      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)

    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference.

    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one.

  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :
    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]

  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :

  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.

    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but
    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the
    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most
    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's event-loop again and again.

  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.

    This "Gfx Context Switching" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Say What!?

  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:

  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :
    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server.

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received
  the following confirmation...

  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was
    essential when I only had 8 MB.

  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :
    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a
    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's
    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they
    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your
    action.

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
    even fewer context switches.

Have you set the foreground and background colors in w_gc1 to 
something other than 0 and 1?  The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros
on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.

Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same?  You could
have different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane (0x10 == 16)
might all be the same value?

If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance,
don't use ClipMasks, just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled
rectangle fill.  Many servers are very stupid about handling complex
clip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
little clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every
one of these little triangles.


Actually, I must also ask the FAQ's #1 most popular reason why graphics
don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle?

 I have just finished building X11R5 on a 386 running Interactive Unix (SysVR3)
and I am having a problem with xterm.  On any font larger that 5x7 it messes up
characters that are types, the cursor seems to be "too" large, or splits into
a 1/2 reverse video, 1/2 outline block (which changes when the pointer is moved
into the window).  I am trying to use monospaced fonts (not -p- fonts).  Is
there any way of changing the appearence of the block cursor is an Xterm?

 Thanks

I am creating a graphics program using the Athena widgets. I use
Xlib routines to install a custom Graphics Contex by obtaining the display,
and window variables with the XtWindowOfObject() and XtDisplayOfObject().
The object was one of the sub widgets.  
  The problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected
the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. I tried moving the allocation
of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing
changed. I am preforming all of this manipulation before calling 
XtAppMainLoop().

Thank you for any help.

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,
and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination
of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the
toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,
but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks
promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm
not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,
and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The
other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.

At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in
C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body
comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me
no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only
library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending
nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause
short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the J curve.

No doubt this is an old question, but I didn't find the answer in the
FAQs I could find, so - here goes:

I have a Sunview application that I want to convert to X (OpenLook,

	a) is that so?
	b) are they public domain?
	c) any good, i.e.

Hello Motif World,

a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got
several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people
who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am
not aware of who are also using Motif++.

My question is:

How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where
people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the
user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this
way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or
changed.

If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to
reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say
about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will
post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X
Technical Conference) has an paper by Mark Linton and Chuck Price
titled "Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco".

The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort.
Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals
as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing
the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib.
Features they want in FRESCO include:

lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C++ programming interface
edit-in-place embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions
sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample
implementation.

I am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above.

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was
able to help me.

The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create
detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until
main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:

main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
The event mask for main_win is:
        PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |
        EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;
The flags are
        PPosition | PSize

I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.
 
If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win
are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some
detail I'm overseeing.

Thanks for any tips

I'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64, I'm using Motif 1.1
X11R4 running HP-UX 8.07 - all the functions return valid results but no
cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size. I tried

using the following code:

unsigned int w,h;
XQueryBestCursor(XtDisplay(programArea), XtWindow(programArea), 72, 71, &w,
&h);

to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 as
the width and height respectively. What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I

Hi *,

Has anyone out there compile a list of X security holes??  If
yes, will you please send me a copy of this??  If this is a
wrong group, please point me to a right one.  Thanks!!

BTW, the list doesn't have to contain the info "How to use
the holes?".  Instead, I need the info of how to detect
the holes, how to seal the holes, and how to monitor the 
activities if possible.

Any info is welcomed.  Thanks!!

I want to create a single-line Text widget for entering a small amount of text.

I want it to be of fixed width, but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls
automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point
visible.

In trying to do this I have two problems:

 - The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget
   taller, but instead it seems to cover part of the text.

 - The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text
   in order to keep the insertion point visible.

Any help is appreciated.

Mike

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to
handle, thus they set this limit.

Didn't your operating system come with X?  SysV usually does as far
as I know.  You'd do best to contact the people from whom you bought

The code fragment looks reasonable, but is your logic valid?
Just because something appears in an 8 bit deep pixmap doesn't
mean every bit plane contains data.  Did you try each plane?

We are currently evaluating GUI builders, initially for Motif but with
a wish to be flexible & portable.  We have been through the popular
names (UIMX, TeleUSE, XVT etc) and have been very impressed with what
we have seen of Galaxy from Visix.  I have spoken to current users
from a list supplied by Visix (happy users as you would expect), and
seen favourable comments on the net.  However, since it is fairly
expensive to get an evaluation license from Visix, I would like to
query the net for any negative experiences with Galaxy.  Did anybody
evaluate them and prefer another tool or use Galaxy and regret it or
find any mis-features ?

I have two Motif Widgets. I would like to control one of them via the
keyboard and the other with the mouse. I set the keyboard focus on the first

Could some kind soul show me how to do this?

I am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system.  In keeping with more classic command and
control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  
I have a number of X level questions regarding this:

(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be 
predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,
and not multiple X displays.   Given this:

	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's
	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
	screens?

	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate
	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?
	What are they; who sells them...

	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a
	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?

	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see
	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware
	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?

	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
	multiple screens instead)?  
	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely
	on providing config files which will specify for each
	configuration the screen placement of each window in the
	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
	are more than welcome.

As to how many clients may be display on a server, I believe the limit
would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
server.

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  "multi-headed"
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
"multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

"zaphod" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

> Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle
> (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ?

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only
recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.
The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been
implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of
the new window.

This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to
provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is
CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't
match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a
border-pixel, and the problem should go away.

There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that
CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to
XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines
CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so
you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib
implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm
not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)

well as sun4_mach, but whenever it compiles on sun4_411, it gives me 
undefined ld errors:
_sin
_cos
_pow
_floor
_get_wmShellWidgetClass
_get_applicationShellWidgetClass

The following libraries that I linked it to are:
-lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11

The makefile is generated off an imake template.
Can anyone give me pointers as to what I'm missing out to compile on
a sun4_411?

Thanx
Wilson





Hi Folks,

Does anybody know where I can find the "Color" bitmap editor
around the public sites? Any information I do appreciate that.

Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. For your purpose put following into your
.login (if you're using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it.

if ( "$term" == "xterm" ) then
	echo "^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}^G^[]1;${HOST}^G"
endif

Note, ^[ stands for <Esc>, in vi you can enter it by pressing
Ctrl-V and the <Esc>. Same for ^G, it means Ctrl-G. In vi:
press Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-G.
The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon.

BTW, you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd:

alias cd 'cd \!* ; echo "^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}: ${cwd}^G"'

greetings,
Thomas

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.

That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could
put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could
have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any
combination.

Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different
in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,
this is 12.

As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.
X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is
not the case.

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of
course, I could say "Buy all you want, we'll support more."

The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read
on...

I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget,
displays the widget for a while, then destroys everything and returns.  The
problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems
including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things):

- Core Dump
- BadPixmap X Error
- Widget not unmapped


Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem:

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>

void bla()
{
        XtAppContext app;
        Display *dis = XOpenDisplay("");
        int junk = 0;

        Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app, "test", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget("blaaa", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        top,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(top);
        //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents
        for (int i=0;i<=10;i++)
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(app, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }

// WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???
        XtUnrealizeWidget(top);
        XtDestroyWidget(top);
        XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);
        XCloseDisplay(dis);
// ???
}

main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
                bla();
}

Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example,
after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program.
With this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent)
the 5th call to bla():

X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
  Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d
  Serial number of failed request:  71
  Current serial number in output stream:  86

If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the
seconds call.

Furthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I
get:

Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice
Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice.


So finally, my question is this:

What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates
an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.

Thanks very much.

Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it).

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors)
The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input
fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the
input field.

The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather
than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although
various sources seem to indicate it can be done.

When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block.
This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the
default either.

Configuration is  : Motorola 88K X11R4

Please reply by email if poss.

Thank you

Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5

	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation
	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version
	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).
	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error
	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the
	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText 
	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 
	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).
	
	Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered
			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what
			to do about?

	I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me. 
	Germans are requested to answer in german.

Use a GC with the subwindow_mode attribute set to IncludeInferiors. The
default is ClipByChildren. However, beware if any of the children are of
a different depth to the parent; the semantics of this are undefined by the
protocol.

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network
itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell
file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our
Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each
segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have
10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.

Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).
It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going
to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed.

Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:

   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */
   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);
   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);

Then to draw I do:

   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);


What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If
the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are
over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor
function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap.
It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look
ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that
the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications
are having to make do with it's colormap.

This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have
seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.
My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display
applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather
than in color (if this is an option for the application).

I need to write an application which does annotation notes
on existing documents.  The annotation could be done several
times by different people.  The idea is something like having
several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other
so that the user can see through all of them.  I've seen
something like this being done by the oclock client.
Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt?
Thank you very much.



Has anyone written a device driver to use the Ascension bird with XWindows ?

As we don't get a newsfeed I was wondering whether there was such a
thing as a Xt mailing list (other than xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu).  I
would appreciate any info on this, (or X related mailing lists.)

        Thanks in advance,

The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its
positioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place.

Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
me; all information greatly received.

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.
	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite
widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :

	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)

but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the
insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:

	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)

Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.
	Many thanks in advance for any help.

The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension.
You can do the same in your widgets.  Few current widgets
support SHAPE, so you'll have to subclass them to add that
functionality.

I think you are running Xapollo , it's a X11R3 server ...

If you want a X11R4 server you should install PSKQ3 (10.3.5) or 10.4
  so you can run Xdomain .

Hi,

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.

  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")
terminology!

  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process
is started by xdm.

  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!

     The setup is as follows:

        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home
     directory.

     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected - very nice!

     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an
     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
     expected.

     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window
     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
     the users session startup?

 ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

     ie: real key       key shown on screen
         ------------   -------------------
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
     expected!

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

  Thanks,

Dave.

Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.
(US-UNIX layout keyboard)  I did install the sunkbd patch, though.

Make sure you're using "ssetroot", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm
starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an "ssetroot" after
tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a "(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&")
You can also use "VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename" or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.

Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:
The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.
Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed.)

Anyone have a fix for the last two?

I am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a
remote display.  A local display being connected to the same system
that the client is executing on.  I have access to the display string
but can I tell from the string?

If the client is executing on host foo then ":0", "unix:0", "foo:0",
and "localhost:0" are all local.  Under Ultrix, I believe that
"local:0" is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection
maybe?).  Are there other strings that I should check for?  Is there a
better way to detect this?

Thank you for any help you can give me.

try this after XCreateWindow:
-----------------------------

#include <X11/Xutil.h>

Display display;
Window window;

{
  XSizeHints *xsizehints = XAllocSizeHints ();
  xsizehints->flags = USPosition | USSize;	/* or = PPosition | PSize */
  xsizehints->x = 42;
  xsizehints->y = 42;
  xsizehints->width = 100;
  xsizehints->height = 100;
  XSetWMNormalHints (display, window, xsizehints);
  XFree (xsizehints);
}

These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
values. If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window
manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user.
I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if
you specify the position and size like above.

Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing
of X/Motif applications. I am thinking of a system which I could
program (or which could record events/output) with our verification
test procedures and then run/rerun each time we do regression
testing. I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX
projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS.

      Try change the GXxor to GXequiv.  I have to do this for programs that
      are to run on NCD terminals (on Sun terminals I have to change it
      back to GXxor)...

There is a small section in the O'Reilly Xlib books that describes
the right thing to do.  The key is to set the plane_mask in the
GC to the OR of the foreground and background pixel values.

Hi there netters,

I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my
screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to
go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with
the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner
so that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller,
which expects the window at the same spot every time.

Thanks in advance.

sincerely,

Sanjeev Sharma

I don't know anything about a "sunkbd" patch, but I use the following

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

Currently, my solution is:

	XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetWMProperties(..);
	XMapWindow(...);
	XFlush(...);
	XMoveWindow(...);


It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

  There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
X11R5 distribution.

  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...
(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using
on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they
were just about equal.

  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous
sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your
application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging SHM apps).

  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.
Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be
attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes
XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24
bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to
support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to
use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).

  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a
Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest.

  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)

Can anyone give me some information, please ...

I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX
platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,
or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?
"Motif" includes Xt in this context.

One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
yet have the spec)?

Answers appreciated,

Nicholas.

The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested
is because that's what the ICCCM says they should do.

This code will almost certainly break.  Calling XMapWindow and then
XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager.  Even if this did work, there isn't a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window, so you don't know how far to move it.  And what if the window
manager refuses to move your window?

	Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server.  xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add NeWS and
everything else, you have a workstation.  There are workarounds, I've
heard, one involving a perl script.  What we are trying to do is
replace programs that need NeWS (like pageview) with programs that
don't (like ghostview).
	Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; I
have no personal experience with it.

  When I run our RS6000's "info" utility through a remote login

  I thought the prob. may have been due to my Sun window mgr. 
  (Openlook) being incompatible with the AIX Motif application
  but I tried it under TVTWM also.  Same result.
  
  So this is presumably an X11 key definition problem between 
  workstations - but my system admins. feign ignorance.
  
  What do I need to do the be able to type lower case into 
  this remote AIX motif app. from within my local Openlook

I am using the GLX widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model
application, under 4Dwm, but when the dialog gets popped up, its
text entry field does not have focus. Aimilar code works perfectly if
I use "pure X" (no mixed-model). HEre is the relevant portion of
the code.

{
   int n;
   Arg wargs[16];
   Widget Button, PopUpShell, Dialog;

   /* initialize TopLevel here */
   .
   .
   .

   n = 0;
   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNlabel, "Foo"); n++;
   Button = XtCreateManagedWidget("FooBtn", commandWidgetClass,
                                  TopLevel, wargs, n);

   PopUpShell = XtCreatePopupShell("PupShell", overrideShellWidgetClass,
                                   Button, NULL, 0);
   XtAddCallback(PopUpShell, XtNcallback, MyPopUp, (XtPointer)PopUpShell);

   n = 0;
   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNvalue, ""); n++;
   Dialog = XtCreateManagedWidget("TheDialog", dialogWidgetClass,
                                  PopUpShell, wargs, n);

   .
   .
   .
}

void MyPopUp(w, popup_shell, call_data)
Widget w;
Widget popup_shell;
XtPointer call_data;
{
   XtPopup(popup_shell, XtGrabExclusive);
}

---

A way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the
application window around a little bit and place it right behind the popup.

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal.

   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have

I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something
which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't
be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this
as an alternative.

   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
   yet have the spec)?

Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you
looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD 
widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list
you could port.

I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the "user" window. Maybe other window managers
have similar options.
Another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

Dear netters,

I have noticed something rather weared (I think) about creating a dialog shell
widget while running HP Vue's vuewm.

For some reason, every time I create a dialog shell the foreground and backgroun
d colors are different compared to my toplevel shell.
I am not doing anything special/different.

Does any body know anything about this problem?? How to fix it without hardcodin
g the colors ?

Please respond to kamlesh@salzo.cary.nc.usa ....

Thanks !

Of course, just using the app context returned from

best option, unless that path is not available.




Hi folks
Thanks to the ones that replied, however, my problem turned out
to be very simple.

In my .Xresources I had a space after XTerm*font:   10x20.
Removing this and xrdb fixed my problem.

Also, same symptom, was that some of my users did not have the
proper capitals for XTerm*font.

Thanks again

Bob




Can someone point me in the direction of any papers (not necessarily
formally conducted studies) discussing how much traffic X apps generate
for the network, particularly in comparison with curses-bases apps 
over telnet?  Also, does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard
input a line at a time?  Can the X client control this, asking for
keystrokes immediately?  Thanks in advance for any feedback!

If you're on the internet and your site isn't sheltered from external
tcp/ip traffic, you can use the Remote Andrew Demo to see what the
Andrew Toolkit looks like:

Remote Andrew Demo Service

This network service allows you to run Andrew Toolkit applications
without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the Andrew software.  You
need a host machine on the Internet, and you need to be running the X11
window system.  A simple "finger" command will allow you to experience
ATK applications firsthand.  You'll be able to compose multimedia
documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the
Andrew Message System to browse through CMU's three thousand bulletin
boards and newsgroups.

To use the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command
on your machine:

    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

The service will give you further instructions.

Is there a PD version of cfb, or other PD server stuff, which has a colour frame
buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode, i.e. where the screen
memory is grouped so that "bit 0 of every pixel is here, bit 1 is there, etc."

The only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the
Commodore Amiga, and it is commercial. I don't know if they wrote their own cfb,
but I suspect they did.

Please respond by email, as I don't read this group.

the slider is on the right side.

I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have
1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is 
1024x768.

I'd appreciate any feedback on capture/playback tools for use with X clients.

I have pulled XTM from public domain but it appears to be set up to test
X servers not X clients. 

Any comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great -
particularly XTM, XRunner, Autotester, and SRI's CAPBAK, SMARTS and EXDIFF.

I have an event handler working for a ButtonPressMask like:

  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, ButtonPressMask, FALSE,
                    show_mouse_position, plot_data);

but I would like to be able to have two types of actions: one to occur
with the left mouse, the other the right, and perhaps one with the
middle.  So my event handler would look more like:


  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, left-ButtonPressMask, FALSE,
                    show_left_mouse_position, plot_data);

  XtAddEventHandler( plot_data->display, right-ButtonPressMask, FALSE,
                    show_right_mouse_position, plot_data);

However I don't know how to make my left-ButtonPressMask.  There didn't seem
to be one in the event mask lists I had on hand (although Button1MotionMask
looked promising).  My references also mentioned using "|" to or two
mask events.  Can you  use "&" to and two masks?  Would I want to in this
case? 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Hello folks,

I'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map:

mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x

I've added a line in the start up file before the line
that starts mwm. It looks like the following:

xmodmap keymapfile
mwm

I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between
function keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned
functions (e.g. Move, Minimize, etc).

The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run

xmodmap keymapfile

from an xterm.

Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically
F1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain.

I realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to
implement, not time to learn how to implement.

Terry



See subject. An opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?).

I am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited
abilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must
run on HP-UX version 9, either with or without the PEX extension. The
sort of things I want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects
such as lines, rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are
sufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the
creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.
text entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.

Does anyone have such an animal? If you do, please mail me with details
including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be
included in a product). Alternatively, send glossies to me at Logica,
68 Newman Street, London W1, including technical info please. For PD
stuff, I have some effort that could be put into porting.

Thanks for any help,
Nicholas Young.

I created a pixmap or drawable window, then used XDrawLine() function 
drawed a line as below fingure:

		width = 300
	================================
	|				|
	|				|
	|			p1	|
	|			\	|
	|			 \	| height = 300
	|			  \	|
	|			   \	|
	|			    \	|
	|			     \	|
	|			      \	|
	|			       \|p3
	|				| 
	|===============================| \
					    \
					     p2

	I created the pixmap or drawable window only with size 300x300.
But I draw line from p1(x1=270,y1=100) to p2(x2=500,y2=800).
My question is, dose the XDrawLine function can finger out that correct
p3(x3 and y3) for me? If you calculate x3 and y3. 

x3 = 300;

@ = art tan (( 800 - 100)/(500 - 270)) = 71.81 degrees;

y3 = 100 + x3/tan(@) = 100 + 300/tan(71.81) = 198.58 ~= (integer) 199.

How do I prove XDrawLine() give me the right x3, y3 or not?
Please don't ask me why I don't created a 900x900 pixmap. No, I don't
wan to. 

Thanks in advance!

Yet again,

the escape sequences you are speaking about here are non standard and
dangerous. In fact, an ANSI compliant sequence parser HANGS on them.

Why are there such strange ESC sequences instead of compatible DSC ?

The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child
without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor.
The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got
picked up by the child.  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if
the timing was 'right'.

|Even 24Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated
|8 bit PseudoColor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and
|thelike to run. I strongly suppose you to emulate at least:
|
|> 24 Bit TrueColor. Should be no problem, only some translation. Rounding
|  should not make big misfits

Depends on the nature of the "rounding."  X allows the user to do bit
arithmetic on pixel values, (i.e.,  XOR foreground and backgroun pixel
values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a
function of GXxor fill change foreground to background and vice-versa).
If your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then 
clients that use them will break.

xgetftp-1.2 needs an archie client program.
Does anybody know, where I can get it?

Thanks in advance, Kai



[Please accept the following announcement for comp.windows.x.announce. -gf]

A completely revamped version of the X11 browser interface to Archie,
Xarchie, is now available as
	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.Z

For those not familar with Archie or Xarchie, I include part of the
manpage intro:

  Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie Internet information
  system using the Prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  Archie
  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the
  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,
  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp
  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows
  you to retrieve files located this way.

Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of
other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the
new features (from the README) follows:

  * Major improvements include:
    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new
      features (FWF MultiList widget).
    - Ability to expand directories in browser.
    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.
    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.
    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable
      pseudo-weights.
    - Online help browser.
    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.
    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.
    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

Can anybody help me?

I am having a problem displaying images greater than 32768 bytes on a Sparc
IPC running Openwindows 3.0 and dni. My program runs on a Vax and displays
images on the IPC with no problems if I use Openwindows 2.0. The program uses
the following lines to display the image - it is the XPutImage() routine
that crashes.

	XImage          *ximage;
	ximage = XCreateImage(myDisplay, DefaultVisual(myDisplay, myScreen),
			      ddepth, ZPixmap, 0, image,
			      xwid, ywid, 8, 0);
	XPutImage(myDisplay, myWindow, myGC, ximage, 0, 0,
		  xpos, ypos, xwid, ywid);

These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these
specific questions.

1.  If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?
My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a 
modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers
in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to
get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that
when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated
(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't
seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all 
O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of 
the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier 
requirements.

2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right
of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left
sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window 
manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone
who has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move
and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y
and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.

Any help would be most appreciated.

I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it (Then again
I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears
for the second time:

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints

PS: I'm working in plain X, using tvtwm.

Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year.  The link I want to use 
though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited.  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you
running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of 
packets go blazing through? What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points?

What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these 
images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.

Hi, everyone;


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and
they agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in
English) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is
that. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at
University of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address
and his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Sincerely,
Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)

P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...


P.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a
regular basis.

Considering it's damaged, probabably has a real old version of the OS

$250-$300 these days.

Hey!  I am interested in buying a digital delay pedal, preferably
capable of sampling and infinite repeat.  (If you're familiar
with Phil Keaggy, I want to mimic, or at least as close as possible,
what he does in concert, i.e., click the pedal, play something, click
it again, and what he played between clicks repeats infinitely while
he playes leads over it)  Anyway, let me know.....

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with
the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for 
even less.

I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I
only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to
UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.
I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also
tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.

Other things to watch out for/consider:

	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.

	For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate
	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the
	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many
	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox
	operator told me I was not telling the truth about
	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them
	before with NO problems), etc. Right.

	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local
	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the
	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)

	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over
	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had
	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)
	have told horror stories about them...

	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by
	Mailbox.

	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I
	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...

	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy
	air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!

	UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!

do not pay $40 for floppy drives.. they are about $40 new.

polypropylene bags, and backed with white acid free boards.  Shipping is
$1.50 for one book, $3.00 for more than one book, or free if you order 
a large enough amount of stuff.  I am willing to haggle.

I have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what 
you've been looking for, and maybe I can help.  Some titles I have posted
here don't list every issue I have of that title, I tried to save space.

Tracy your monitor is on its way. Mike Damico
                                                                                  



I have used JVC's top of the line portable cd player for three months now.
I have mostly used it in my car on long trips, so it has less than 20 hours of use on it.  The unit is one of the best that I have seen and listened to, but
I am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car.

Features include:
	17 Hz - 20,000 Hz
	rechargeable nicad batteries
	wireless remote control
	AC adaptor
	headphones
	carrying belt and case
	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
		25 presets, 5 user programmable
	RCA connections and cord
	JVC compulink capability (cord included)
	programmable from remote
	intro, random, repeat playback

I will include a Discwasher (tm) power converter to convert an automobile's
12v DC to the 5.5V DC that the unit requires.  I had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits, (JVC makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at Radio Shack etc).

I paid $235 for the disc player and another $30 for the power converter.
I will sell the disc player alone for $180, or both items for $190.

Wanted:  color monitor >= 14"  suitable for use on a Macintosh

like to part with, please email me with the specs and price.

Thanks.

Since I have some free time while looking for a job I thought 
I would offer Linux on disk and tape for those who need it.


NOTE: I am offering this service for EXPERIENCED users who 
require no support.  Simply put I am just a disk shuffler.  If 
you think you will need support I HIGHLY recommend  
Softlanding Linux System (SLS) directly.  They provide an
excellent product at a decent price with support.

I am the lazy mans service, for those who don't want to spend 
4 hours on the modem and 2 hours shuffling floppies.  And 
those who don't need SLS support and opt to go it alone.

What you get... each disk is $1.50(5.25) 
                             $1.75(3.5)       (14 disk minimum).

A Minimal System     : 4 Disks   6.00/7.00
B Base System Extras : 7 Disks   10.50/12.25
C Compilers          : 3 Disks   4.50/5.25
D Documentation      : 2 Disks   3.00/3.50
S Source, misc.      : 1 Disk    1.50/1.75
T TeX                : 3 Disks   4.50/5.25

I'd offer $150 for your scanner, shipping at your expense, payment to
be sent by personal check within 24 hours after receipt of goods -- or if
you live nearby and can deliver, payment in cash with 24 hour advance notice
so I can go to the bank.  If sent by mail, I reserve the right to return
it at my expense if when I check it out I find it to be defective in some
way.

BTW, why would you sell such a fine scanner?  Did you replace it with
some other instrument or find it not to be satisfactory in some way?

The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car
stereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I 
don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.

As to deterring theft:

When I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800
number.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most
people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial
numbers do catch theives.

Just a thought,
Michael

Hi,
I am one those uncles that try to please my nephews whenever possible,
so.. they have asked me to find them some Nitendo games, no, it is
not for the super nitendo.. it is for whatever model came prior to
that.

Since they are overseas, I will first ask them if they already have the
games you would have to offer me. Please send me a list, or whatever and
the price you are asking so I can send to my nephews and find out what
they have and what they want.. so bare with me, I will respond, but it
will take me a while. 

Thanks,
Walter

I agree. I own one. Aside from the shutter, it is built like
a little tank. A very good camera. Your price sounds reasonable,
too. New, I paid $565 for my KIEV 88 Camera Kit. Good luck.

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or
02106@brahms.udel.edu

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

I have a pair of Oakleys that cost about $100 new a year ago.  I hardly ever
wore them because they just don't look right on me.  They are orange and
blue and are the "blade" kind (Terminator style).  I am willing to sell these
for $40 to the first response I get. 
I also have a Bulls vs. Blazers game for the SNES that is in perfect
condition.  I am selling it for $35.  It includes the instruction manual.

That's one.  Any others?

Then they should have used a different advert.

I'm both.  I've made some $4k worth of PC products purchasing
decisions for one company I'm affiliated with in the past 6 months
alone.  (In a delicious bit of irony, an interesting fraction went to
suppliers that I suspect got my mailing address from these people.)
More is in the pipeline right now.

If they wanted to discuss these sorts of things, upfront is the
way to do it.

>When you get a catalog there's a "VIP Code" you

And who issues that "VIP Code"?  (That policy implementation in the
running for this week's "silly twit" award.)  BTW - It turns out that
I have several VIP codes.  Here's the one I'm using for these sorts of
things: "6".  (If you want one, send me mail and I'll put you in touch
with the folks who do the application interview; if you qualify....)

   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******

 * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)





IM pleased to announce a new revolutionary device that allows you to
copy super nintendo and genesis games to floppy disk.  Then later
play from floppy disk with out the cart.  This is a independent system
that interfaces with your SNES or Genesis.

OTHER FEATURES

*Store multiple copies of cart. save game to disk (up to 32 saves to disk)

*Save your position in SNES games that don't norally have a save feature

*Switch your SNES into slow motion mode

*Use codes to get unlimited lives and other "cheats" in many games.

The Multi-Game Hunter is capable of copying both SNES and Genesis game 
carts to standard IBM PC formated floppy disks. The games can them be played directly from the floppy disk. NOTE:IT does not require a PC

Full color on-screen icons and menus make operation for the MGH so simple
that even a child could operate it.  Options can be selected simply by choosing the selection with the game controller and pressin a button.

Add a Game saver adapter to your system for more game playing power.  The
Game saver allows you to save your position to disk in almost any SNES game!
Reload your saved position any time.  Enable it's slow-motion feature for those really tough games.

For more control over game play, We have the Game finger software.  The
game finger software can give you unlimited lives or warp you to new levels in
your favorite SNES games.  Bring back to life those really frustrating games.

Also if you know how to program 6518 6502 ASM code you can create your own
SNES demos or games.

MGH includes

Base unit,disk drive (high density 3.5 drive), 16megabit RAM, 256 SRAM,
all adapters and comes ready to hook up to your gameing system.

ONly thing not included is the power supply which you can pick up at
radio shack.

All for only $500

They were also selling "Babes in Toyland" (the SCOTT BAIO version!)

Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right
along with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta.
Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine
Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.
Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1
You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track
have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.

***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see
for your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

Quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,
and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak
from expierence!)
I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.

NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta
is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one
source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I
haven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,
(so they are similair.)

	Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre
 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having 
chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are 
appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the 
moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.
If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car 
should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. 
 The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes 
that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting 
the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.

This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my
1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)
with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been 
sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through
4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed
(front wheel drive included).

Concentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of cars
in snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform
adequately in less than ideal conditions.

An aside: 
I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have ever
driven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of these
next winter.

   You're apparently including names that are, or appear to be,
derivatives of real words in English or some other language (e.g.
Acura, Infiniti, Maxima, Altima), in which case you missed ones such
as Integra, Supra, Allante', Capri and Calibra.  In Canada, add Serenia and
Precidia.  If you count misspellings, add Protege and (in Canada)
Vigor.  How about the forthcoming Mondeo, if it is given that name
in North America?

   Others might include Celica, Corolla, Paseo, and Tercel.  In Canada,
add Asu"na.

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.
How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget
allows, the Land Cruiser? 
Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.
Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
on-road comfort.

How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the
sole use of a automotive repair......maybe for people who have a hard time saving
money or don't want the hassle of  worrying about paying for everything the 
extended warranty is worth it.....for some people it is worth it...others not, and
for some the peace of mind knowing you won't have too many unexpected expenses
is enough.....if you drive a lot, your basic warranty can be up in a little longer than
a year....how many people can make the car payments as well as large repairs....

It may work for some people......

Left hand steering wheel placement was not standard until the 20's in the
US. Driving on the right has been standard since standards came into being.
Interestingly, Chrysler has just begun building right hand drive cars again
for export to Japan.



DeSoto's first year of manufacture was 1928, so this may indeed have been
an export special, as left hand controls were standard here by then.

 My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and I
think its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru
dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer
told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to
disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.
At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto
but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any
SVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is
true, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car
looks great.

I test drove a Mazda 626 LX this past weekend and 
liked it.

The dealer offered it for $15K.

1) Is this a good price?
2) Any comments on 626 in general? 

Please use email. Thanks

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0
and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.

No Integra I have seen comes with all-season tires. 
The GTZ does come with much bigger 16" wheels.

The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype

16.1 sounds reasonable, probably faster than regular Integras.

The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra
equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.

The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It
was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.

The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k
miles, a rare screw up by Honda.
Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

Your Passat VR6 is designed to run on premium gasoline, however the
engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done
to the engine with lower octane fuel.

You will likely, however, get somewhat more power and fuel mileage
(especially in hot weather) out of this particular engine if you do
run it on premium.

	My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires.  I took
out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before I learned
this fact.  I immediately bought XGT H4s which are definately all-weather.
A Carrera 4 I walk by everyday has XGT V4s on it even.  The Michelin dealer
where I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different 
rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing.  
Said he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in
Texas and not Colorado.

Thanks,
Eric

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed
side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but
it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.

The year after Iceland also changed.

About cars: Before the H-day (H as in "Hoegertrafik". "hoeger" is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa?

BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)

I understand Caddy is working on one, double battery, super high perf

The problem is that the guy at 1600 Penn. Avenue is about to get it

Not to my knowledge; I know GM does conversion work for things like 
hot climates (i.e. the Chevy Caprices sold to the Middle East) but 
things like that are always done by third parties, NOT the manufacturer.
Maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefed-up everything,
perhaps the police cruiser package on the Caprice/Crown Vic and start from
there.

"And I wuz drivin' along in my armored Seville STS and this punk pulls out
of nowhere with an RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade) but the bulletproof
windshield stopped him" :-) Don't think many people on the net have a need
for bulletproof cars. 

Check with local armored service companies/security/bodyguard places. They'd
know best. I think your average luxury car dealer will have a coronary if
you told them "I'll take the blue Caprice, with options FZ01 (Fuzzy Dice),
PR11 (power everything), and AR007 (Armor).

I believe an article on the conversion process appeared in the car press within

This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector 
cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is
hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on
the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is
pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent
itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to
fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)

Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a 
discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron
(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however,
a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper
injector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the
$59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to
do it.

Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  There has been a clutch 
replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
cost you some $$.

My brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably 
normal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.

What kind of tires does the car have on it?

Several years ago GM was having trouble with the rings sticking on the
5.7 diesel.  They traced a cause to the use of 10W-40 oil.  They would
not honor warranty work if 10W-40 was used (if my memory serves me).
5-30, 10-30 or 20 50 was OK'd though.

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too
shallow to use!

I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when
she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from
would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who
as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).

Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes
you rear look wide as a cows!

 Also, to have the habits that
work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater
what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)

A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside,
none on the inside). I have men's coats that have as much as 6
pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!

As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you,
women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!

When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and
my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent
than the pants pockets and looks better.

Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is
paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem.
A woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e.
Image some red necks yelling at you "We are going to FUCK YOU!"
and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight
on you!)

If you want to find out why a women does something, LIVE AS ONE!

Awww, right, you want all the home mechanics lined up against a wall and
shot eh?

Bull Pucky you chicken! Read the service manual and get your head out of the
sand! Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment
rack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not
more accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work.
You can do an `acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and
some imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangering
anyones life. The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well,
you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able
to steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision is
so poor that they would screw up this badly!)

I bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall
with sand paper will kill millions of people. It aint magic. Go take the
certification course, and look at the people that have never learned to add
in their whole life that are taking the certification!

BTW, I am disgusted at the Colt (and some of the other Chrysler offerings)
because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them. My '84 Chrysler
Laser (Similar to the Daytona, a reskinned Colt) needed a realignment every
3 months ... Bolt a good grade 12' 2x4 to each wheel, using a carefully welded
spacer jig. Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more
difficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the
space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on
upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain).
This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up
*right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that
the original poster might not ...

Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket A/C units.  I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp
(forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with
it.  The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  I will never have
an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again.  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience.

I'd like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers. If they see you,
they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle
finger extended. Because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane
ahead.  



                                                      H.H.M.





  A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received.
 In short:
     The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions
   I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the
   intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.
   A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left
   and gave me the ticket.
     The officer said "The only reason that you even slowed down in the first
   place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right
   through"


  I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for
 help. To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine:
 PHGHGHGHGH..

 The judge sided with me and decided that in this case "Not stopping" was the
 safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY.

  The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very
  slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made
  the judge decide on his verdict.


  Moral: If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case,
	 go for it. It is a very interesting process, and it is there for
	 your benefit. Exercise your rights.

This is just not so - many of the earliest cars had their steering
controls in the center of the vehicle, and there is no discernible
pattern of left- or right-hand steering controls until a few years into
the 20th century, when, in America at least, left-hand wheels became the
pattern. The mule team (or horses, I imagine) explanation, however,
seems to have some merit.

  Well, before we start calling the Engineering folks in France a bunch of

  My 1979 Mercury Capri had this lovely feature. This was not the earlier

Come to think of it my brothers Zepher had this as well.

I don't know about trains, but I've saw a sign on the back of a
Greyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off.
It doesn't explain why, but it does set off my radar detector.

Archive-name: rec-autos/part1

[most recent changes, 15 March 1993: addition of alt.autos.karting -- rpw]

               === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===

This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general
description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and
some suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting'
will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of
newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos
groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't
understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at
least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please
subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the
documentation provided there.

Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:

rec.autos.tech

is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,
construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely
inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.

rec.autos.sport

is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving
automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,
spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.
Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)

rec.autos.driving

is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.
Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert
your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.

rec.autos.vw

is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,
Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing
list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as
a mailing list.

rec.audio.car

is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and
so is mentioned here.

rec.autos.antique

is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years
old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)

alt.hotrod

is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the
rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing
performance vehicles.

alt.autos.rod-n-custom

also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar
American hobby of customizing older cars.

alt.autos.karting

for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.

rec.autos

is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.


Crossposting:

Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed.

Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular
audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector
articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are
almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or
rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.

Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually
inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is
truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.

Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of
radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.

Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
rec.autos.

It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of
articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to
misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these
three.  The life you save may be your own.

Distribution:

There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution
field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.

The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, 
the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the
following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article
headers, and on article content.

1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford
Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in
either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange
reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)

2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which
your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences
between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,
all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel
injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These
differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.
Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation.

3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;
in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas
Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos
reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.

4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when
possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can
(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state
abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted
to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put
"ny,nj" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated
values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area.

The Dangers of Overgeneralization:

To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:
Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is
true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly
different from those in Idaho.

The Need for Adequate Specification:

When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;
e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,
model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be
quite useless.


Concerning Lemons:

At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all
`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from
the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information.


Concerning Flames:

As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section
of this posting):

If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a
minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and
you'll get exactly what you deserve.

If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe
bald, unsupported assertions.

Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.


Asking the Question:

It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please
send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to
end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest
I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses
to this request'.

Answering the Question:

If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.
Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --
it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly
address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see
your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
self-righteous.


Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:

Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of
them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings
about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some
of these topics include the following:

1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con

2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
    radar detectors.

3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.

4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why
    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue
    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)

5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's
    right to own and operate a radar detector

6)  `Buy American' discussions

7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates

8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible

9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?
      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the
          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.
          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]

Archive-name: rec-autos/part4

[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly
asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions
of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate
crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]

[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,
    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]

                Commonly Asked Questions

Radar Questions:

Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit
    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in
    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,
    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They
    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.
    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other
    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.

Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?

A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,
    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe
    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.
    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently
    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate
    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.
    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected
    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a
    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned
    on.

Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?

A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance
    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target
    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR
    system.

Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be
    able to handle it? 

A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a
    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the
    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.
    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low
    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar
    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,
    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use
    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:
    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they
    are used (or else, don't speed.)

Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?

A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.
    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.
    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the
    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the
    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.

Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:

Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?

A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a
    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)
    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to
    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they
    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',
    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)
    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that
    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into
    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle
    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance
    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing
    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle
    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or
    spinning.

    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car
    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the
    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling
    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to
    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle
    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater
    slip angle than the front wheels.

Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?

A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear
   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally
   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop
   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle
   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to
   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.

Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?

A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while
   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot
   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you
   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to
   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;
   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side
   on the throttle.

   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the
   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing
   the same thing.

Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?

A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of
   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for
   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the
   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with
   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch
   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission
   speed up.

   The procedure is as follows:
   (0) declutch
   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral
   (2) engage clutch
   (3) match revs
   (4) declutch
   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear
   (6) engage clutch

   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.
   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the
   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or
   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.
   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at
   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good
   condition.

Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and
   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?

A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and
   2) almost never.

   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times
   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the
   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine
   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite
   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from
   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*
   major) part of the equation.

   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really
   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically
   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the
   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.
   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads
   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply
   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.

   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the
   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced
   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the
   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making
   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end
   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car
   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'
   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of
   caveats could go on for page after page.

Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according
   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate
   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?

A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.

   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics
   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,
   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a
   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating
   temperature.

   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser
   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a
   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been
   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match
   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire
   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses
   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling
   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire
   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will
   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its
   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some
   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like
   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.
   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal
   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of
   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)

   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,
   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters
   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than
   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible
   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of
   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques
   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.

A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked
    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names
    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER
    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.

Q:  Does VW own Porsche?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and
    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,
    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some
    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may
    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this
    is only speculation at this time.

Let me add my .02 in. I had a A/C installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the A/C that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine. I have talked to other people that have had the same
result. Don't know if this is just a probable with Ford or what??

A little bit off of the subject but here goes
yes he is one in the same (i.e. Chevrolet Motor Div)
also his brother Gaston raced at Indy and was the winner in 1920.

I bought an Intrepid about two months ago and am very happy with
it.  Lots of room inside and even with the smaller engine it has
enough power for me.  The only problem I found was a small
selection on the dealer's lots. They are hot sellers around here.

I don't know if some lemons are out there, but from personal experience
My brother's has been trouble free.  Not one single repair, only 
regular maintainance.  The only work he had done on it was a result
of his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn 
on a busy intersection, and was rear-ended.  He has a 1989 Plymouth
Sundance.  I would recomend it, but I would also like to say that if
you can wait about six months, ChryCo is coming out with a new car
called the Neon, that is built in the same way as the LH's where.
Good luck with your desiscion.

the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions..  i get much
stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup.. which i can induce
by briefly lifting off,  then quickly (but not too quickly to trigger
a kickdown) applying throttle.  above 3000 rpms, the convertor will never
unlock;  it would kickdown first.

who says there's no skill involved in driving an automatic?  i think
of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal.  with
my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my
right foot, while having both hands to steer.

Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at
the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where
God intended it to be. :-)  I drove two different cars then (the other an
1984 Camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to
blow the horn.  The only time I got it right was when I was getting the
annual state-required safety inspection!
Not one of Ford's better ideas.

I grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs.  The jump

Dear Netters:

I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon '91 or '91 TSi AWD.
Question is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the
April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid!

In particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,
and brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine
ownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one
stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something
about sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem
too bad if one "beats" on his car.

I am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can
anyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any
problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.

Thanks for any responses!

In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U.S.

Sunny California is a 1.6l wagon based on Sentra.

No. reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up. They

Well, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction

If you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for
the back of the car. These work very well - and are a good way to get
rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone.

Why crawl under the car at all? I have a machine I got for my boat that 
pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube. It does an
excellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more 
old oil out than by using the drain plug. I think I paid $25 at E&B Marine.
The oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant into
your favorite device. I use soft drink bottles. Easy to take them down to
the local oil recycle center.

FORZA!





I was following an example of the LH the other day, and noticed the fit
between the tunk lid and the rear bumper.   The gap was quite small on
the left side, but much larger on the right.  Blech!!!

Stuff deleted...

I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport
for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the
freeway.  Several persons were killed when said blocks came through
their windshields.  Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and they
have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stop
such people).  Yet many bridges are NOT fenced.  I always look up at a

Hi, maybe someone can help me here...
I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now.
The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it.
A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi).
The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification
he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced
to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before
selling the car to me.)

Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know
what this could mean...
Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?
Or is this an indication that the car was abused?
Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?
The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,
I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away
in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.

Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and
well kept, it's currently out of warranty
(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km
worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for
any repair bills...
But, I also need a car for 5 people...  

When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?

I would very much appreciate your input in this.
Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.
Thanks!

Ryan

As unfair as it may seem, the difference between Chrysler and Toyota is
that Chrysler needs to prove that it can build quality cars. Toyota can
afford make a few small mistakes without hurting the image.

After all, door seal failing on a 6-year old Stanza is not comparable to 
the same problem on a brand new Intreprid.

I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5, what they lack in power they
surely make up for in handling.  Great for back streets with heaps of corners.
They are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free
revving DOHC engine, a fun car.  Have you driven a TURBO converted
MX5?  Now they are starting to perform!  I've often thought a Mazda rotary
would go well in the XM5 too....anyone done it?

So its an automatic? Don't know if US spec=CDN spec. for Maximas.

If it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. My car
eats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing the
muffler too is also ok.

>Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?

The mileage is fairly low - but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Check
the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve
adjustments, timing belt changes and so on.

The 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.

Well, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a
car with highway miles. 
Might check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires he
has been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets,
a hard driven car 6-10 sets.

Well, the Maxima should be pretty reliable - but if its out of warranty
you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. Stuff
for Japanese cars can be expensive.

1995 model year, I believe.

I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway
at night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country
you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between
day and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of
rather tall oaks) it is DARK, except for nights with full moons.
Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly
prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights.

	I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple
strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut
going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a
tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?

	Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using
shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening
the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry
will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the
intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom
of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore
the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer
is the only way to go...

Yep.  They are popular vehicles.  You don't see a lot of previous model year
ones sitting on dealer's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are
out.  The things sell, they are popular.

Because they are popular, and high-priced new, they are high price used, very
simple.

I knew they were overpriced when I bought it... I knew they had a terrible 
reliability record when I bought it.  But I didn't expect anything like I
got, especially with a dealer network unable to repair it.  Personal experience
has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine.

   I have had good luck with my Ranger and Yokohama 371 S+M tires.
   The tires have been wearing well and even the few times i have hauled
   heavy loads they have done well.     



You can be sure they wouldn't do it if it wasn't to their advantage.

	They were designed for speeds of upwards of 80 - I forget the
exact spec - but for military vehicles.  That's 80 in a 1958 Dodge 
Powerwagon.  Not 80 in a 1993 Ford Taurus.







Alright, beat this automobile sighting.

Driving along just a hair north of Atlanta, I noticed an old, run down
former car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older
rare or exotic foreign sports cars. I saw:

Ford GT-40 (!), the famous model from Ford, that seemed to win most of 
its races in the late 60s, including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times.

Two Jensen Interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?

Porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)

THREE Ferarries, a Mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model
that I couldn't identify.

And at the bottom, a late 70s MG convertable.

Outside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly
sold in the U.S.

And in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an Alpha Romeo
or a Lancia. It was about the size of an Austin Mini.
The trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator 
in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from
the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk
and go to the outside from here.
The taillights looked like they
would be the round type (if they were there). Does anyone know what the
make of this one is?  

Certainly made my day...

Well, the MGB is currently in production for the English market, built
by Rover. It now has a V8, improved suspention, and a slightly
updated body. Too bad it's only available in GB and would set one
of us back about $42,000+.

Although, others have in the past and will continue to disagree
i think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm.

I think that it is important to protect your trunk, engine bay, all
doors.  I'd get flashing lights, LED's mounted on the drivers and
passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in 
a glass break sensor, and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock,
two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.

Most important is where you have the installation done!  Some places
may cost a little more, but a poorly installed alarm (no matter how
much it cost) will be a major burden.

IMO, things like engine starters, voice alarms, window/sunroof open

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar
information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..

I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)
after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, 
and Celica.

Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  

My criteria: a "fun" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.
I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.
The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.
Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).
The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.
The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  
I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.
The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.
The Celica was "ok" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat
overpriced too) in non-turbo form.
I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.
Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)

The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its
reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:

My dislikes:
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.
Headlights have "stuck" up a few times (weather?)
air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.
crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).
assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not 
stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.
Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner.
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 

My Likes:
engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1
handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)
transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)
Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)
stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)
low cowl (good visibility in front)
Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)
ABS/Air bag (see above)
rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)
No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't
have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling
point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  

The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed
much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the
Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.
If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently (if that's "better" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about
the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so
I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  

I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume
that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles (and I was really trying).  
There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm
rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth "pouch"
but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.
And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!

Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

     "NO COMMENT"/They're coming to take me away, Ha-Ha! -- Napolean XIV



Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's 89 Ford Probe.  Every
once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
under the plywood/carpet cover on the trunk.  I would guess this usually happens
after a good thunder storm.  A few Qs:

1) Is this a common problem?
2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?

Thanks for any info.

   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New
Car Guide.  What I found was a car would be given a 'Recommended'
under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a
driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed
in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small
car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small
cars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles
where you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

No, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.

Unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on
paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card
automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also.

Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and
require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The
credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.

I have never rented from Alamo, so I don't know if they follow this
same practice.

>Is the beretta a good rental car?
Yes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and
acceleration-wise, but very adequate.  It will have an automatic
transmission, AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, and possibly power 
windows and door locks.

My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  
The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but 
lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was 
defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below 
market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average 
retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but 
the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the 
fact that if you have an automobile that does not 
depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive 
to deal with you.  There is no way that the 
manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and 
sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded 
a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's 
representative at the hearing tends to support this 
point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not 
seem to take the proceeding very seriously.

I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am 
getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have 
to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon 
myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on 
the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to 
my elected representatives telling them how utterly 
ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for 
a "use deduction" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  
As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying 
for my insurance.

Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton
HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 
this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems 
that required attention included the transmission, 
heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main 
problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They 
could not install a non-defective transmission in at 
least four attempts.

So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but 
you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you 
paid too much in the first place, or if your car 
happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.

However, I feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings (see

members of this group.  You are attempting to make the members of this group
be REQUIRED to answer.  The only people who should make a statement are people
who have experienced the problem and found a workable solution.

Many people are interested, but have no input.  I will restate that your last
sentence here is seen as an attack on the members of this group.  If people have
input, they will give it.  If they do not, YOU should not make them feel 
compelled (sp?) to respond.  

If you wish to continue this conversation, PLEASE send e-mail.  DO NOT repost or
attempt to bait me, I will not make another post (and may I make the same a
suggestion to other group members) on this matter.

I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing.  It's only been in the last
year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.
VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for
passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would
actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.

VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the
article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and
Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have
the quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US
launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk
of the useful life of the design is spent.

I think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same
quality and availability issue.  It's a nice car with a nice engine.
Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a
different question...

I'll leave the Passat / Camry flamewar for someone else.

It depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying "unsafe" econoboxes
instead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only
thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.
I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are
lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.

Hmmm....I was listening to the local radio expert (who is, amazingly
enough, an Honest-to-God Expert(tm); it's amazing what he knows...), 
and he said that, based on his conversations with the inventor of 
Slick50 (who is no longer with the comapny, due to some kind of 
conflict), he avoids it like the plague.  He does recommend other 
teflon-based/type oil additives, though.

The answer to your question is...sort of. Volkswagen had a
much less robust version of this army vehicle out in the
early '70's (or thereabouts). It was called the Volskwagen
Thing, and was, of course, a convertible. I havent seen
many around then or now. Good luck...

Shades of the Edsel! They had pushbuttons in the steering wheel hub
that controlled the auto tranny. It was very disconcerting to shift
into reverse when turning a corner and the wires shorted.

I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every
30K to let you know it's time for a check up.  When that light goes on, I just
take it to the delaer tell them "It's that time" and they work on it for 4 hou
and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)
I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for
service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the
Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have
never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.
Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have
something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only
MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced
if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and
Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  

What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need
to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for
another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light
bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against
the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light
will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't
find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little
and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?

Having spoken to technical staff from Ford many times, I can assure you that 
internally at Ford this car is always called the Taurus "Show" or just  
"the Show".  As in long "o" sound.  I still refer to it as the "S-H-O",
however, because it sounds better to me. I assume many purist fans and owners 
prefer using the Ford lingo.

not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel
_I_  or my car couldn't handle it, but because of exactly what you said:
drivers who are STUPID.  Like the ones who are doing 130 also, and so
they pull in right behind you at maybe 1-2 car lengths....oh yeah, real
smart...  This scares me in cities at 50.  When i can't see enough of
the car to make it recognizable, they are following TOO CLOSE.  And 
when i see them doing this AND reading a newspaper.....*sigh*...this
is why America has 55-65 speed limits: our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise
that reading the paper should be done at breakfast, or work, not in their
car.

--
My boss is interested in a new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon.
Does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions
on this car (or line)?

Particularly, I would like to hear about power (manual t. only)
reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the
line.

She currently drives a VW Passat, and is being plagued by its
electrical problems.  The dealer claims there is nothing wrong,
even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them-
selves while you are driving down the road.  The automatic shoulder
restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along.
She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite
dissatisfied with its lack of power.

The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems
such as the Passat's electrical system.  She is also considering
a Saab 9000 (add some letters).  Any comparisons between the 9000
line and the Mercedes would be helpful.

Price is not an impediment.

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another
time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive
engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under
the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various
floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd
spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.

So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out
the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed
to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the
outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these
gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.

Probably because there are many children there.  Also the minor fact

Sorry, but *neither* 'dictates' the cost. It's a negotiation.
Whether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out 
dickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale
(ie, if saturn can't sell at it's price, the price drops,
or the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated
value controlled by market forces. To think that the consumer 
controls price is ludicrous. If the consumer controled
price, then cars would be *free*...And no one would build 
cars.

Here in Houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her
garage, so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand.  She
found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle.  She quite
reasonably asked him to stop.  He refused, began taunting her, and
as the woman was quoted in the police report, "He told me to go
ahead and shoot him, so I did."  The moron survived, and no
charges were filed against the woman.

In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane.  Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  

Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  

BTW, If no one else is around, then GO FOR IT!.

On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the "electronic"
odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven
by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are 
converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer.
No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage
reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to
change as any other mechanical odometer.

On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor
and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple
switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter,
which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)

A list of options that would be useful. They can be existing
options on a car, or things you'd like to have...

1) Tripmeter, great little gadget. Lets you keep rough track of
   mileage, makes a good second guesser for your gas gauge...

2) Full size spare

3) Built in mountings and power systems for radar detectors.

4) a fitting that allows you to generate household current with
the engine running, and plug ins in the trunk, engine compartment
and cabin.

I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurance
companies in California to get estimates. I asked for the same
coverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you
according to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.
Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's
what I found (for a '93 Integra GS):

AAA: ~$2000/yr.
State Farm: 2614.92/yr.
Allstate: 1220/yr.

AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about
$200-300 back at the end of the year.

Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm
wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be
suspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.

Any comments?

Thanks,
Gregg L. Kasten
gregg@cs.stanford.edu



All you have to do is turn it in to the police like you would an accident,
get a report and send it in to your insurance company and they will contact
the other guys insurance company and they will have to pay just as they
would in an accident they caused.  Thus no need to go to court.  A friend of
mine did this and he got the money so it does work.

Definitely!

Safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car. I won't buy a 
small car like a Civic or whatever.

Great = Safety + Handling + Speed  -  for me

Seems to me that you would be more "dead" in a small car than a large car 
after an accident.

Yes this is a common problem.  The leaks occur through the seal of the 
taillights.  Unfortunately, Ford has this with Most Probes and does
not have a recall for it.  Very dissatisfying to say the least.

>2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?

There is no drain holes that I know of.  I used a margine tub to drain it
Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn't fix it
under warrantee.  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system
including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in 
the trunk.  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would
not retract.  So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced; 
$90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket
which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that
when I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the 
covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.

very annoying.  Don't let the water problem go--get it fixed or you'll pay
more later.  Considering how common a problem it is I hope every one
complains to Ford.

I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really
hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
hand both come crashing into my face.  After coming to, which is
about 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time
all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck
down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain.  Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil.

It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice.

  greetings:
  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of
the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a
mould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle
floorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about the
vw thing i used to own is that it had about 3" more suspension
travel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-
market parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  note
that the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing
are the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external spare
mounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)
sharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped 
hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more
luggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a
nut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half
of it...).
  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stopping
at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the
two big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get the
number for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to
norway before calling...).

later,

Least you think bad taste is something new:
Back in the early 1970s I saw a couple of cars with *flocked* paint jobs.
Thats not a typo. I think they sprayed on some kind of glue then blew
on tiny pieces of nylon. It comes out looking like felt. Can you picture
a huge Plymouth Fury III in dark blue felt? I think I can even remember
one guy who did it in red to a early 1960s Corvette. That was after he had
turned it into a station wagon.

Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The
pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold
weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the
fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a
normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply
suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will
cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where
the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to
fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is
getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

	Well, let's see, in just my own _personal_ experience there's
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, Utah, South Dakota, Nebraska, 
Minnesota, Montana, Florida, and parts of Louisianna.

	Nobody said "Let's go into town and drive 130 on Main St."
And you couldn't go that fast on the graveled washboard that passes
for highway in some parts.  But that "only really expensive cars should
be driven fast" crap, is, well, crap...

o Subaru Service Manuals ................................... $10.00
     This is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 
     & 6 which cover MECHANICAL COMPONENTS (suspension, wheels 
     & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater 
     & ventilator, air conditioning), BODY (body & exterior, 
     doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument 
     panel), and ELECTRICAL (engine electrical system, body 
     electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). 
     These are the genuine Subaru issue manuals.  They are for 
     model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that 
     applies to other years as well.

     Solid cherry (no veneer).  Handmade, with very interesting
     dovetail corners in the drawers.  Built (we think) around 
     1880.  Not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant 
     piece of furniture, but too big (60" long, 37" tall, 24" 
     deep) for our little Cape Cod house.

OK...

5) How about a fuel gauge that *really* told you how much fuel was
   left.  Like, "can I make it to where the gas is $1.14 or should
   I get gouged right here at $1.35?"  Accurate to the tenth of a
   gallon would be great.

Well, I've driven in every state but Alaska, and drive about 60k per year.
I take long cross country trips any chance I get - its fun for me and I
can get reimbursment.
My job allows me to drive rather than fly. Not to labor the point, but
I've driven just about every freewayin the US, Germany, UK and France plus
some in Mexico, which was surpisingly good.

Yes, but as a %age of the total freeway in the US? 
All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard, advising people to
slow to 85 or so.

Texas freeways are varied, sometimes a good surface. Mostly flat. But,
I5 in CA is comparable and hilly.

Given the absence of other traffic and car built for 130 (e.g. 535) 
most US freeways are just fine. The problem is other road users and

True 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this
but I'll dump my impressions.  I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years
now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake
of my life!)

Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set
in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit.
The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the
engine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together
here.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger;
a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.

Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you
can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.

The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild
washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good
bug/porsche mechanic would be easy.  Since it is mid-engine you may spend
more on labor for any mechanical work.

I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be.  I believe that automatics
should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise
would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.
More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery
instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive
always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should
be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.
	In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster
that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For
normal driving go with the manual.

Gads, I have heard so many horror stories with Taurus and Sable cars!  I thought
these were premium American automobiles.  The way they sell, you'd think so.
Is Ford really no better than in the late '70s when it was turning out tin

W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.  The lockup only
occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG.  Mind you,
a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG, but the additional
mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked
converter clutch) than its inherent losses take away.

According to _The Complete Guide To Specialty Cars_, 7th Edition, from
Crown Publishing, it's the VW Kubelwagen (w/ 2 dots over the 'u').
The company is:

   011-47-30-26601 voice line

An excerpt from the blurb:

   ...This fine Kubel clone from Wolfkam is a very close copy of
   the original, and offers the same all-weather and cross-country
   capabilities as its WWII forebears.  The robust fiberglass body
   kit is very complete, and includes all the hardware you will
   need, except for your own VW donor car.  The phone number [...]
   is the entire AT&T dialing sequence; call and ask for Karl
   Torum, or send $5 cash or _International Money Order_
   for a complete literature package.


George.

P.S., I'd be happy to share what info I have on other kit cars and
      kit car manufacturers.

P.P.S., I'm looking for a used or partially completed Porsche 356
        Speedster Convertible D replica from Intermeccanica.  I'd
        appreciate any leads or advice/stories from any owners
        out there.

You got off cheap.  My sister's ex-boyfriend was such an incessant pain
in the ass about wanting to ride my bikes (no way, Jose) that I
finally took him to Lindner's BMW in New Canaan, CT last fall where
I had seen a nice, used K100RS in perfect condition.  After telling
everyone in the shop his Norton war stories from fifteen years ago,
signing the liability waiver, and getting his pre-flight, off he went...

Well, not quite.  I walked out of a pizza shop up the street,
feeling good about myself (made my sister's boyfriend happy and got
the persistent wanker off my ass for good), heard the horrendous
racket of an engine tortured to its red line and then a crash.  I
saw people running towards the obvious source of the disturbance...
Jeff laying under the BMW with the rear wheel spinning wildly and
someone groping for the kill switch.  I stared in disbelief with
a slice hanging out of my mouth as Matty, the shop manager, slid
up beside me and asked, "Friend of yours, Steve?".  "Shit, Matty,
it could have been worse.  That could been my FLHS!"

Jeff hadn't made it 10 inches.  Witnesses said he lifted his feet
before letting out the clutch and gravity got the best of him.
Jeff claimed that the clutch didn't engage.  Matty was quick.
While Jeff was still stuttering in embarrassed shock he managed
to snatch Jeff's credit card for a quick imprint and signature.  Twenty
minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty
presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror
and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack
and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.  Or he could buy the
bike.

I'm not sure what happened later as my sister split up with Jeff shortly
afterwards (to hook up with another piece of work) except that Matty
told me he ran the charge through in December and that it went
uncontested.

That sounds like an awfully closed minded, intolerant attitude.

1/2  :')     

I'm not a redneck but . . . try a walk in their shoes first.  Stereotypes
are usually of very limited value.  I've seen as many ignorant
self-righteous "open minded" new age lovers of the great planet Earth
as I have ignorant "red necks".  I don't see a correlation. I don't
believe that the "redneck" culture, if you can call it that, is
necessarily inferior or superior to any other.

I'll be preaching tolerance . . .. and I'm a conservative.

Even a half a beer will increase your confidence while slugging your reactions

IF you can remember to tuck properly, the bits that are going to take most 
punishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet, then hips and 
knees. Get boots then  trousers. The gloves come last, as long as you've the 
self control to pull your arms in when you tuck. If not, get good gloves 
first - Hands are VERY easily wrecked if you put one down to steady your 
fall at 70mph!! The other bits heal easier.

Once you are fully covered, you no longer tuck, just lie back and enjoy the 
ride.

Best of all, take a mean of all the contradictory answers you get.

I remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil 
requirements, and one of the ways of prolonging
the life of the oil was to run through a heated
un-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles
to boil off. This made such long-term usage of 
oil practical.

All right people, this inane bug wibbling is just getting to much.  I
propose we split off a new group.
rec.motorcycles.nutrition 
to deal with the what to do with squashed bugs thread.

What?!?!? Haven't you heard about cross-posting??!?!? Leave it intact and
simply ignore the basenotes and/or responses which have zero interest for
a being of your stature and discriminating taste. ;-)

Yesterday, while on Lonoak Rd, a wasp hit my faceshield with just
enough force to glue it between my eyes, but not enough to kill it as
the legs were frantically wiggling away and I found that rather, shall
we say, distracting. I flicked it off and wiped off the residue at the
next gas stop in Greenfield. :-) BTW, Lonoak Rd leads from #25 into
King City although we took Metz from KC into Greenfield.

Dean, there's an old engineering saying concerning inventions and
wheels.  Contact #0099, he's done several runs of patches, and there is
some patch-making company out there with the artwork already set up and
paid for.

Really!?

Methinks somethings wrong with _your_ bike.

Perhaps you meant _pull_?

Pushing the right side of my handlebars _will_ send me left.

It should.

Oh, lord.  This is where I came in.

Obcountersteer:  For some reason, I've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For
example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe
I need psychological help.

Obcountersteer v2.0:Anyone else find it ironic that in the weekend-and-a-
night MSF class, they don't mention countersteering until after the
first day of riding?

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court
a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and
plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity
to listen to some of the "creative excuses" offered the judge by others.

After listening to a number of "Well, I was passing a very slow truck
that suddenly speed up" versions, I decided that the judge had heard
just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than
impressed with any of them.

This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a
rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.
He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph
zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had
alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.

The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose
and said in his sternest voice: "Well son, those are some pretty
fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for
your self?"

"Well Sir", meekly the defenant replied, "I just was over to my
buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home."
He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and
was doing 110 mph on his way home.

The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the
maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him
to attend remedial drivers training school.

Isn't America Great??

I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth.
But if you were to travel all the way forward, you'd collect the top
triple-clamp in a sensitive area. I'd hate to have to make the choice,
but I think I'd prefer the FJ's gas tank. :-)

----------
The '84 GL1200A hit the traps at 13.34 according to Cycle magazine. Yeah,
they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then
they bottom out. Got my '86 GL1200I w/ 2275 miles on the odometer for
just under $5K in May of 1990 and would ask for $4500 now with almost
16K miles onnit....that's about 50% of what a new GL1500I would cost.

Think the '86 GL1200I originally sold for $6500 brand new, not sure. 
If that's the case then it depreciated 30.77% over 7 years or a mere
$2000. Big Fat Hairy Deal! Based on what I know, Harleys tend to
depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service. All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesn't always wash away the
knocks on them...such as being much slower. ;-)

I'm about to undertake changing the fork seals on my '88 EX500.  My Clymer
manual says I need the following tools from Kawasaki:

57001-183  (T handle looking thing in illustration)
57001-1057 (Some type of adapter for the end of the T handle)
57001-1091 No illustration of this tool and the manual just refers to it
           as "the kawasaki tool."
57001-1058 Oil seal and bearing remover.

How necessary are these tools?  Considering the dealers around here didn't
have the Clymer manual, fork seals, and a turn signal assembly in stock I
really doubt they have these tools in stock and I'd really like to get this
done this week.   Any help would be appreciated as always.

Again, from my alcohol server's class:
The absolute *most* that eating before drinking can do is slow the absorption
down by 15 minutes.  That gives me time to eat, slam one beer, and ride like
hell to try to make it home in the 10 minutes left after paying, donning 
helmet & gloves, starting bike...

I ride my bike regularly to classes with my book bag.  I take
the shoulder straps on the bag, and hook them around the rear turn
signals.  I works fine.  You probably will want to attach it with
a bungee cord to keep it from shifting to one side or another.

Put the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest.
If that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the
backrest, just make sure it doesn't bend or break anything like the rear
fender or turnsignals.

Never had any problem with mine...

Are you *SURE* the nut/bolt you are trying is really a 1/2" hex?  13mm
is just slightly larger...  and a 1/2 wrench won't fit on a GM 13mm
nut (my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it...  really annoying, metric
threads too.  Seems that most of the body is metric, most of the engine is
SAE).

Because of this I cannot in good faith recommend a Seca Turbo.  Power

bike of choice would be more appropriate because the powerband is so wide

Because it wouldn't be a Jeep if it didn't. A friend of mine just bought one
and it has more warning stickers than those little 4-wheelers (I guess that's
becuase it's a big 4 wheeler). Anyway, it's written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times, and it looks like they've made
it a pain to put it down anyway, from what he says. To be fair, I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers. They may participate in this discussion, but they're
probably few and far between, so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers.

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant (the lower case part) of the 
two parts of the statement. Besides, around here it is quite rare to see 
bikers wear goggles on the street. It's either full face with shield, or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses. My experience of 
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that non-wraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes.

Ok, ok, fine, whatever you say, but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point. I've been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs (and my jacket would be a blood-splattered
mess) and I'd see guys with shorty helmets, NO GOGGLES, long beards and tight
t-shirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens. Lets be really
specific this time, so that even Ed understands. Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with one's face is fun, or are there other reasons to do it?
Image? Laziness? To make a point about freedom of bug splattering?

  Not with a hub cap but one of those "Lumber yard delivery
trucks" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road
and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of
spackle came off at 70 mph. It got real interesting for about
20 seconds or so. Had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
spackle off Me, the Helmet and the bike when I got home. Thanks 
to the bob tail Kenworth between me and the lumber truck I had
a "Path" to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up
the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). A car in
front of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and
nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.

The messiest time was in San Diego in 69' was on my way
back to the apartment in ocean beach on my Sportster and
had just picked up a shake, burger n fries from jack in
the box and stuffed em in my foul weather jacket when the
milk shake opened up on Nimitz blvd at 50 mph, nothing
like the smell of vanilla milk shake cooking on the
engine as it runs down your groin and legs and 15 people
waiting in back of you to make the same left turn you are.

	The word is "subrogation."  Seems to me, if you're willing to wait
for the money from scumbag's insurance, that you save having to pay the
deductible.  However, if scumbag's insurance is Scum insurance, then you may
have to pay the deductible to get your insurance co.'s pack of rabid, large-
fanged lawyers to recover the damages from Scum insurance's lawyers.

	Sad, but true.  Call it job security for lawyers.

On the back might be tricky, but here in Boulder, there is a guy

Of course, the dog is always wearing WWII style goggles (no joke)

For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to think
about airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from 
Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated
at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to
the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay
pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used
a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.
	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front
fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube
frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to
do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two
vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing
follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.
The compressor is about 2" in diameter and about 5" long.
	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small
so there should be plenty of good places for it.
	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to
mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side
just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the
horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where
the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough
room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice
cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.
	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out
about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look
closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight
ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).
	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try
to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them
first.
	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound
more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.
I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has
not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).
	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though
they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping
the pedestrians on the sidewalk.
The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to
those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)
and are relatively easy to install on the FJ. YMMV.

OK -- so we've got a hotly contested BMWOA election and some inept 
leadership.

My question is the history of the BMW organization that lead to the
formation of the BMWRA. Was there something going on in the OA years
ago that precipitated the formation of two competing owner's groups?

Just to stave off flames: I'm a (relatively new) member of both groups
and besides a difference in the slickness of the magazines, it seems
the major difference is that the RA guys seem to have more fun. . .

Hi. I have been thinking about buying a Motorcycle or a while now and I have
some questions:

-Is there a buying guide for new/used motorcycles (that lists reliability, how
to go about the buying process, what to look for, etc...)?
-Is there a pricing guide for new/used motorcycles (Blue Book)?

Also
-Are there any books/articles on riding cross country, motorcycle camping, etc?
-Is there an idiots' guide to motorcycles?

ANY related information is helpful. Please respond directly to me.

Thanks a lot.

Herein lies the key to this thread:

Kindly note the difference in the responses.  Ed (and I) are talking
about knowing riding technique, while Mike is arguing knowing the physics
behind it.  It *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
(ie: push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way) *without*
having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
and such as seen in the parallel thread.  That stuff is mainly of interest
to techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles  ;^),
but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering.
Mike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction.  I know people
who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who Newton was.
On the other hand, I know very intelligent, well-educated people who
think that you steer a motorcycle by either: 1) leaning, 2) steering
a la bicycles, or 3) a combination of 1 and 2.  Knowledge of physics
doesn't get you squat - knowledge of technique does!

Anyone in Europe got any advice for a US citizen whose going to be living
and working in Italy for a year and wants to buy a motorcycle there?  An
Italian friend just arrived here in Washington State to work for two years,
and she's finding it very very difficult to obtain car insurance.  So I
thought I'd ask...

I have a US license, with motorcycle endorsement (unlimited displacement),
and have had for 30 years.  I am also a Washington State Motorcycle Safety
instructor, if that info might help.

I will post a summary, even if it's just of my own personal experience in 
buying a bike and getting it insured after I get to Italy.

The Yammie Deltabox and the Hawk frame are conceptually similar
but Yammie has a TM on the name. The Hawk is a purer 'twin spar' 
frame design: investment castings at steering head and swing arm
tied together with aluminum extruded beams. The Yammie solution is
a bit more complex.

Yes, yes, yes.  Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us.  This
is the nature of people, and one of the beauties of the sport.  

|Cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
|(what they like and dislike about motorcycling). This is not closed-minded. 

And what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds, a veiw
that, of course, no sport-bike rider could possibly hold?  Please quantify your
generalization for us.  Careful, now, you're trying to pigeonhole a WHOLE bunch
of people.

I don't think this is the case, at least not on all jetskis.  On my
friend's jetski, bars turn left to go left.  Anyway, all you're doing
there is changing the yaw of the jets, so the relationship between
the handlbars and the rear-mounted jets is completely arbitrary
(simple linkage could make it work either way).

It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion
than snow skis.  But it *has* been an amusing digression.

Hey Ed, how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horse's reins
left to go left?  :-)  Or am I confusing two threads here?

  I sure hope you got the cost of a replacement panel out of the owner. Here if

I think you have to go a little further back.
This opinion comes from riding CB750's GS1000's KZ1300's and a V-Max.
I find no enjoyment in riding a V-Max fast on a twisty road.

I moved to Sweden and I have to take all the tests again (written and

Of course I became a resident, and could drive on my US license until
I became resident.  Don't know about Italy, it's different in the EEC.

I generally find that after two or three decent hits of nitrous, my riding
improves enormously.  Drinking is silly, your breath smells, it costs lots
of money and the pigs can detect it with their machines.  NO2 works for me,
try it.

Ya, Fat Chance.  The "offending" rider was a moto journalist.  Those
guys can sell hundreds of bikes with one stroke of the pen and
as such get away with murder when it comes to test bikes.

One way or the other, it was probably worth the early expiration of 
one mufler to see a bone head get his butt baked.

> -- 

This is not good advice.  A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed
getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)
hit the pavement with a "clunk", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the
paint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the
helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a
fiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.
This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a
wider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam
liner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.
They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination
of the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or
outside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they
would inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet
with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would
compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.
(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim
prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)

The bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity
can be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure
is to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet
manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point
to consider when purchasing a lid.

Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired.
Isn't that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such?

Say, that's another thing that bugs me.  Why don't people scrape their

Is it possible to do a "wheelie" on a motorcycle with shaft-drive?

Mike Terry
'82 Virago



 
 Sigha.
 
 1) Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T... Are 
there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a "slip-in" bulb replacement)?
 
 2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my "not damn near bright enough" 
incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. So I went and 
picked up this cheapo "Motorcycle battery and charging system tester"... 
Hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on "Very good charge"... Start 
the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's 
supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at 
the same point as just the battery.
 
 My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, 
how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be 
darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...
 
 Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they 
just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?
 
 Is there an easy fix for this?
 
 3) Happy noise: Put 300 miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an 
endorsement.... which is REALLY GOOD, because my cage just quit running 
worth a damn and I won't have money to repair it until the first... ;) And 
the weatherman says "Bright and Sunny all week, 20% chance of rain on 
friday"...

I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.

Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on
his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I
actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.

I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and
rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to
invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then
I also passed my road test.

On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a
4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),
I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,
skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the
oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was
also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under
a car and been killed.

Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the
Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training
could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater
since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff
as I did.

So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I
wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you
happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until
you're ready to use it.

>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have 
>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too 
>ignorant to know I need to buy)

While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in
DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you
save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,
plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure
the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up
machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration
and licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not
including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.

I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200
in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial
coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be
poor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo
more expensive.

>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?

There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle
magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or
recent models might be available.  You could probably look through
past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first
bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice
instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that
are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by
noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around
and they were generally set up the way I wanted.

Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting
showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,
were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and
quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence
cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.

 Whacha mean 'we'...ifin they (whom ever 'they' are) want to stereotype me

  If you were refering 'stereotype' to infer a negative - you noticed we

	I'm not sure that's true.  Let me rephrase; "You can file a complaint

 "citizens arrest" does not have to be the physical detention of
 the person.

 Better now?

Many private places ban bikes.  For example, the famous 17 mile

that sported a "No motorcycles allowed" sign at the entrance.

And there have been public places.  Call the AMA and ask for
Jim Bensberg (sp?) or any one else in their Legislative Office.
They will recound the many public places that they had to bring

from public parks to full cities.  There are probably a few fights

donate to their legislative fund.

These are the figures from the Performance Bikes lock test, taken without
permission of course. The price is for comparison. All the cable locks
have some sort of armour, the chain locks are padlock and chain. Each
lock was tested for a maximum of ten minutes (600 secs) for each test:

	BJ	Bottle jack

	BC	Bolt croppers

The table should really be split into immoblisers (for-a-while) and

Pretty depressing reading. I think a good lock and some common sense about
where and when you park your bike is the only answer. I've spent all my
spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of
my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in
relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to
manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway, since the weekend there are only two
bikes :( and no, he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock, it was too much
hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8
weeks (if they don't decide to investigate) for the insurance company
to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin.

Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US
but very common in the UK. The UK distributor, given in the above article
is:
	Michael Brandon Ltd,
	15/17 Oliver Crescent,
	Hawick,
	Roxburgh TD9 9BJ.
	Tel. 0450 73333

The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required.

Don't lose it

Some will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. I don't know how much
the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the
tuchus steerers. I was one, I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way,
and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course.
I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but I only
started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed
(off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been.
I knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew
*that* it works, as I could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later
in my normal riding. Just a data point. I think that it's not a bad idea to
bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first
lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry
about proper handlebar technique.

I have. In our beginner course we had passenger training. Sometime during
the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student
would take him for a ride. If the student did not give the instructor the
"you are a sack of potatoes" passenger speech, the instructor would steer
the bike and make a general nuisance of himself. It was amusing to watch,
I'm just happy that it didn't happen to me.

>John Stafford 

  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. I had a BMW R100RS
that was a wheelie monster! Of course it didn't have the initial power
burst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also
had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a 
bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
time. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear
in the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was 
NO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of "slip" device in the shaft
to prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!

  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane
do a "stoppy"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike 
up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don't recommend these
activities anymore (now that I'm an "old guy" with kids of my own) but
it looked damn impressive!!

  If you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed
in that direction! :-)

Cheers, 
B**2

I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
(read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty, 
fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).

This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much
of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go?
I want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and
I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  Are there traditional
signals for SLOW DOWN!! or GO FASTER!! or I HAFTA GO PEE!! etc.???

I really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that
she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...

Thanks,

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.
That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  Cops are not the
only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who
witnesses a crime can do so.

Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation, give them a
description of the car and the license number, and tell them the
specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
(ie, search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy).  Fill
out the ticket and sign it.  It will go through the same system any
ticket a cop writes goes through.  If contested, you will have to
appear in court to prosecute.  Your word will not carry the same weight
as a cop's.

Hi folks.
 
I'm going to be buying my first bike and I'm considering an 82
Honda Ascot FT500 with less than 5K miles. Does this sound like a
reasonable choice? Is there anything special I need to know?
 
Thanks.
 
-Nathan

I've got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ1100, and it ain't too good. It's
difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tank/fairing/sidepanel layout,
and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches,
so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right!!
If I was buying another I think I'd go for a magnetic one.



being a mere female, I have often found I can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers, so I found a more subtle and nastly
ooops I mean nasty way to get back at them. If somebody cuts you up, just wait till they have pulled out past you, and then gently lean over and
bend their aerial, every time I have done that it has eventually snapped
off near the base - which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace.

Hmmm.. The LDDC security guards over here in Docklands only place parking

From _Cycle_World_ magazine (5/93) (who usually never says _anything_
bad about any motorcycle):

"The Max certainly has motor, but there are some things it is short of.
It is short of chassis.  It loves straight lines; aimed in one, it is
nicely stable.  But it is not overfond of corners.  Forced into one, it
protests, shaking its head, chattering its front tire, grinding its
footpegs, and generally making known its preference for straight
pavement.  Bumps?  It doesn't like them either.  Its fork isn't too bad,
though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking.
The shocks, though which work on that short-travel, shaft-drive
swingarm, are firm to the point of harshness."

Apparently that last post was a little hasy, since I

Plus, one palced will give me C7C for my car + liab on the bike for
only 1350 total, which ain't bad at all.

So I won't go with the first place I called, that's

Well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie.
The rear gear does climb the ring gear and lift the rear which gives an
odd feel, but it still wheelies.

Go fast. Take chances.

Dogs will chase anything that moves. I have two dogs and they love
chasing me when I ride off. They will also chase any car that passes
, running along the footpath/sidewalk at up to 60kph. They don't
seem to go after trucks though, the size difference must be a factor.

It also works in my favour though, I can exercise them quite easily
by riding 1/2 mile up the road and back a few times. 


JA (s851708@minyos.rmit.oz.au)



I don't want to do this, but I need money for school.  This is
a very snappy bike.  It needs a little work and I don't have the
money for it.  Some details:

	~19000 miles
	Mitsubishi turbo
	not asthetically beautiful, but very fast!
	One of the few factory turboed bikes... not a kit!
	Must see and ride to appreciate how fun this bike is!

I am asking $700 or best offer.  The bike can be seen in
Bennington, Vermont.  E-mail for more info!

	What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody _red_ rear
indicators.  You'd see a single red light come on and think, "Now, is he
stopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody
_red_ rear indicators?"  This being Survival 101, you have to assume he's
braking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes
out and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_
rear indicator.

Up to this point, I really thought this had been written by a 
pro-SDCN, anti-mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
sarcasm and biting remarks.  Somebody like me, for instance.
The lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the
original poster.

But then the scales were lifted from my eyes.  Looks like Robert is
really being serious.  Oh, well.

I compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition,
which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet
finished at a frustrating sub-.500 level.  The 1987 folks didn't 
ever amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, IMHO.

Any other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's
editions (in the style of 1993 Braves = 1971 Orioles)?

Bob, I think that Stark does this sort of thing as a joke, not as a
serious prediction.  I don't really see why we should shoot him for
that.  The guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming
how great the Royals' chances are in the AL West, since all evidence

							April 1, 1993


I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used:

For position players:
	lowest batting average
	strike-outs
	caught-stealing
	errors

For pitchers:
	losses
	blown saves
	higest ERA
	'taters allowed

This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie
league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway,
someone offered:

Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black

I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott.
However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season.
Should I make the trade or not?

Your comments will be appreciated.

Y'know, if current trends continue, the Florida Marlins will be the first
expansion team to go 162-0 and outscore their opponents by 486 runs.

Don't knock Vaughn for being a spring training .400 hitter
but a .250 regular season hitter.
Around 30 games played isn't an indication of how good any
hitter is, and the quality of pitching is way down.

I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others
to be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these
were completed before the first pitch. :-)

AL East
1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division
2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.
3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect
4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop
5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing
6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th

Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top
          4 gets pitching should win it.
1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?
3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.
4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here
6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs
7.  California Angels - will win no games

NL East
1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!
2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga
3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected
4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a "team"
5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me
6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing
7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing

NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2
4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993
5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.


NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota

World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo
AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))

I believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (I don't remember 
a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length 
is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long 
as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be 
periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day 
that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I 
believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When 
there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists.

Did anyone notice the words "NOT FOR BASEBALL" printed on the picture
of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA
Today? Any reason given for this?

Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in
the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout.
On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the
last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan
pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of
publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are
both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing
and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.

	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the
SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how
important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in "defense".  

	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  

	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.

	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors?

I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an Orioles-Red Sox game in  
Baltimore on Saturday, July 31st.  I haven't been to the new park,
and I was wondering if anyone out there can give me pointers or good tips  
or anything helpful about the place so that I can enjoy every moment spent
there.
For instance, what time do the gates open?  Do we see the Orioles take BP?
When will the Red Sox take BP?  Anything you can tell me would be 
appreciated.  Thank you in advance. 
Please respond to my e-mail address.

It depends.  If you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform
at a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent 
develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer.
If the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.

Open question -- which was more important to the expansion clubs, the expansion

Avery was the #2 overall pick by the Braves, behind Mark Lewis (I think) in
1988.  John Smoltz came over to the Braves from the Tigers, but was developed
by the Braves.  Jeff Blauser isn't a bad player.

I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the
Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East.  It was also his career high
48th. 

Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the
1986 ALCS.  The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away from
the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in
baseball.  The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same
thing done to them in the WS against the Mets.  Speaking of the METS,
isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST
mirrored the 1980 NLCS with the Phillies??  The Astros have been
painfully close twice I must admit.  




This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary.  VERY
scary!  Don't get me wrong, Im a Phillies fan but as late as last
year they looked helpless.  The funny thing was they did have a lot
of injuries in '92 spring training that basically killed their
chances.  Of course, don't forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the
first or second game?

I think he just wanted to get Henneman some work, because the

Last year Brein Taylor was in A ball, probably at Tampa in the
Florida State League.  I believe he began this year in AA which
is Albany.  Hopefully George won't rush him and he'll be
allowed to progress at his own rate to AAA and then to the
Bronx.  This guy is the real thing.

Let's see... April 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he 
hasn't done too much so far!

Cut this guy some slack. Danny will produce this year. It's scary to think
just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.

The Yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good
bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. Also, I like Buck Showalter. Frank
Howard on 1st is also a good move. Everything sounds good so far. 

If the Yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. This 
is the most fun I've had watching the Yanks since "78!

Why are the Red Sox in first place?  Eight games into the season, they
already have two wins each from Clemens and Viola.  Clemens starts
again tonight, on three days rest.

What's up?  Are the Sox going with a four-man rotation?  Is this why
Hesketh was used in relief last night?

Hm.

P.S. I was wrong.  The Sox have already scored 18 runs in two games
this week.  They should reach 25 without trouble.  I still think it's
a fluke.

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good.  I use the phrase "happened to be" advisedly.
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to "turn it up a notch" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who
tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.

I agree.

Wetteland comes off the DL on April 23rd, and will be evaluated on the 24th.
He is throwing well, and without pain on the side.

DeShields is not on the DL.  He suffered from the chicken pox and lost
(this is the official total) 12 pounds.  He will be back, hopefully,
next week.

Walker will be back this tonight or tomorrow...

Are you for real?  How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have?  If a

Well, based on your argument, Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve the Hall of
Fame.  He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time
and could throw hard.  Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of
losing seasons, lots of walks.  No Cy Young awards.  How does Nolan
Ryan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 Major
League seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of his
teams games in 1972?  He doesn't compare.  Not even close.

Kirby Puckett hasn't done it long enough for me.  Give me 5 more
seasons like he's been having, then I'll think about it. 




It was my impression watching the Mets & Rockies that umpires were
calling strikes above the belt, too, but not as far up as the letters.
It would be nice if this were the case.

Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%.  They are 5th in
the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.

Pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
or 58-104.  Need some pitching help, fast!

Good news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs
w/o any pain.  Threw 80 pitches yesterday.  Should be back
in a couple of weeks.  Maybe we can trade him to the Yankees
for Militello.

And thus, we come to one of the true beauties of baseball; these things, along
with many others will never be separated. Almost *everything* in baseball is
situational and interdependent. This is what allows us to carry on all the
arguments that we have. If everything could be explained and balanced on a
statistical basis, none of the wonder and mystery would be left. Why we might
have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself.

The Phillies usually play at either 7:05 P.M. or 7:35 P.M. Eastern Time for
weekdays.  On Sundays the time is usually 1:35 P.M. Eastern Time.

Boise is in Idaho.  Idaho is in part of the Mountain Time Zone and in part
of the Pacific Time Zone.  The times that were given were for Mountain Time
Zone starts.

Am I supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down? Just wondering.
I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially
for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games
in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other
countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also,
many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only
available through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free
of charge and has no copyright restrictions.

>if you want to send updates and scores, set up a private mailing list
>and use that.

Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the
rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through
private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that
branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list
grows by an average of 35 people a day.

If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to
rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. If the response
is overwhelming against the posts, I won't do it anymore. 

Thanks for your time.

Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch
every Braves game. They are the only team that has all of its games
broadcast nationwide. And if you don't like your local team, or you don't
have a local team, the Braves can kind of become your local team because
you can watch them every day.

Why?  Do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until
he reaches his seventy-third birthday, or something?  Why is it such a
strange concept that a forty-one-year-old Ozzie Smith might be a defensive
liability in 1996?

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If
Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No
team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950's for all teams.  

Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created.

I meant to comment on this at the time.

There's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was,
runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.  

Runs Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and
there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
remaining percent.

Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated 
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over 
New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started 
with a solid single to right, moved to second on "Bob" Kelly's infield sneaker
down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a 
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.

Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only 
given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double
by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who 
argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, he
should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed.

The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must 
have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's
single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson
failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:

Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)

The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's
ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back
singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.

Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended
up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a 
week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went
to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings
work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.

The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today.  The Mets are 6-5.

Currently, he's all over.  He played 2nd when Deshields was out.  He was
shifted to third when Delino came back.  And today, he played SS for a cold
Wil Cordero.  

His natural positions seem to be in the middle infield, but they will seemingly
find a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot.

Sorry, but this is the biggest load of bunk I've seen in a while. 
a) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now.
Nobody was even vaguely interested.
b) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince,
who was out of options.
c) LaValliere's release had nothing to do with him being through. He
was released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught,
LaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday
catcher.

Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties,
the offense should actually improve with this move.

Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).
Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably
only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

Am I missing something here?

No, currently there's no room for him in the rotation.  Key is having
a Most Impressive April.  Abbott is pitching well.  Perez is back.
Wickman has pitched his way into the rotation, and is holding his spot
with an outstanding performance his last time out.  And Kamieniecki
isn't doing too poorly himself.

If the Yankees find themselves in need of a starter, Militello will
get another chance.  Until then, he'll have to wait in line.

Owen only has one error so far, I believe.  That seriously
underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.

Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine
fielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't
reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!

This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to
Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees
is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!

I've only seen one game, Abbott's first start, but there were three
balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality
defensive players.  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.

Cheers,

circa June 1986.

1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk.

2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.

3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing.

What would I do, if I were Jose?

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could
still hit 600+ HR.

Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a
Colt .45.  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace.
Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter.

They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two
games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory
(Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the
title; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the
Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead
against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way
tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they
scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis.

Hank Greenberg was probably the greatest ever.  He was also subject to a
lot of heckling from bigots on the opposing teams and in the stands, but
it never seemed to affect his performance negatively.

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which
is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some
interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more
if there is interest.

Yankess (to the tune of "Subterranean Homesick Blues")

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of "Like a Rolling Stone")

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said "Beware Cone, he's bound to roam"
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of "Highway 61")

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of "The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter")

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He sits in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have been the Tampian of the world!

Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies.
So above prediction is doubly wrong.

My prediction: The Red Sox-Cubs Series and Vikings-Broncos SuperBore will
occur at the end of the world.

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this 
year.

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.

And the Rangers fade will not begin until...August. They'll give way
to the Angels. But still challenge to the end.

For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib

I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does
not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively.
Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)
I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.
 
As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who
beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.

I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that
Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make
a perfect throw?
 
I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't
forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/
Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I
will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading
in the right direction.
 
One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,
but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the
East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they
lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

Actually, they're pretty worthless, if you want to evaluate players
with stats.  RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned; all they do is
confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.

Uh, so?

You've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players.
Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game.
Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods
which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's
where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.  These
simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's
offensive contribution to the team's runs scored.

Thank you for making our case.  Have a nice day.

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.

>I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P
>rated Baerga higher, actually.

Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.
 
Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.
In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then
a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the
throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.
 
Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza
batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder
and Webster.
 
Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.
The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single
by Offerman.
 
By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but
the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive
plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner
trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who
had strayed a bit from first base, etc.
 
Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into
the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going
through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw
to third and EASILY got the runner at third.
 
My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.
 
Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game
with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.
 
Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3
innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning
game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh
given his light work out Tuesday.
 
Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit
to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted
in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it
3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next
thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on
first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had
scored long before that.
 
Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.
Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros
and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).
Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but
that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his
third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my
free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this
up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year
honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs
of a sophomore jinx year.
 
The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.
Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.
 
Dodger

I hope there are some surprises here: Raines above Muisial?  Carter above
 Bench?  Ripken above Banks?  Bonds above Mays?
Check the numbers of each player in comparison to the numbers of the rest
of the players that year(s), and you'll see that I'm fairly close with
this ranking system (which is primarily based on Total Player Rating) for
four consecutive years.

Enjoy,

But why would you want to use RBI?   RBI is an attempt to measure is some
combination of clutch hitting and power hitting.  If you believe in
clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with RISP.  If you want to
see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.  

In terms of evaluating players, RBI totals are better than nothing.  But
why use them when so many better stats are out there?

 I am looking for a source of American League baseball stats for
individual players in the same format as printed in newspapers, ie. I do
not want to provide a list of players and get back nice printed reports
for $35 a week.

Does anyone know of such statistics availability and an idea of the
cost?

The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers.  I don't think they have a backup now,
but they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder.  You don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a
competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.

The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first
at-bat this year went 394 feet, if I remember right (I'll have to check
my scorecard at home).  I think that's the longest so far in the Kingdome
through the first stand (five games) there.  A weak showing, despite some
promising taterball candidates ... Ben McDonald, Rich DeLucia, and the

I'm confused.  How is it Hal McRae's fault that he can't win with a team 
whose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt?  I mean, let's be real.  Kansas
City will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end
up near .500; they have less offense than any other team in baseball, even
if you count the expansion teams.

Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know
he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than
Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he
have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?

I remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across

I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, "I'm Polish, not Jewish."

So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP
to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release
is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar
could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff
Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.

If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't
signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once;
it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.
But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did
keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.

I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw
live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).  
1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981.
It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter.
Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,
Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that
time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into 
Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.
Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost
came back though...
2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so
far.
and
3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left
the stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!

Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently
on several occasions.  

Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical*
year with the Mets.  

Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which 
*is* all that Kong did.

Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's
because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.

>Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both

>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.

Not.  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has.

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't 
noticed.

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.

>     Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors

as goos as the guys you're running down.

>something

That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the 
Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been
excellent.

>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to
>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?
Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.

The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As 
more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  

And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,
etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability
throughout most of his career.

Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know
what you mean.  

As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't
lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.

Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM
gets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but 
doesn't score them all himself, who cares?

Consider:

Player A: single.
Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
Player C: Double, B to 3rd.
Player D: Sac fly.

B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team
more than A and C?  Think hard, now.

As you wish.

I have lived in the Boston area for 15 years now.  They have been talking
about a new Boston Garden (hockey/basketball) since I've lived here.  One
day the "last hurdle" has been overcome, and the next day there's a new
hurdle.  Fans have been grumbling about Foxboro Stadium (or whatever it's
called this year) for nearly as long, but there are only preliminary
proposals for a new stadium.  Local politics prevents anything from being
done in a timely fashion.  There will not be a new ballpark in my
lifetime.

All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder
after throwing a curveball that didn't loosen.  Because of the cold
night in Denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than
let him pitch.  He is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation
(expected to be April 20, at Shea vs the Giants).

Incaviglia which was literally at Inky's neck, and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it. after the swing, Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ball--he didn't even turn around to look, or
even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left-field standard,
some 70 or so feet about the Green Monster (over 100 feet above the
ground total!)

truly an amazing shot.

That depends.  Just how much older were they?

Dunno about Miller.

If you mean Scott Erickson, currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent
Good Player, he pulled a muscle in the neighborhood of the rib cage that
made it essentially impossible for him to pitch temporarily, and is
expected back on the mound Sunday.

I thought that Walt Weiss was jewish.  I seem to recall this
was mentioned once while he was still at Oakland.

Also, I have my suspicions about Esther Canseco (nee Haddad).

One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it
crumbled very quickly during play.  The blue dye that was used somehow
affected the vulcanized rubber of the puck, decreasing its cohesiveness.

Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver
dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the
anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are
used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket
change right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only
dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative
coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of
thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no
chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's
the current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no
one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or
whatever it is).  Thanks again

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the
crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-
istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they
still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the
game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the
NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is 
bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect 
examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being
benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals
that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to
attract, that these players are indeed superstars.

It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much 
at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that
McDonalds makes good hamburgers?

Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-
bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of
one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-
ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better
off without him.

I've had, and still have a few aluminum sticks.  I got my first when I was 15
(a Christian), and broke the shaft halfway through the season, two years 
later.  I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season, 
and I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid 
off, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get, 
but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for 
dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my 
experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, 
but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.

I like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench 
if you have to.  On the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to 
impale yourself on it :-)

More like Philadelphia making dust out of dead Leafs.
Roger why do you continue to embarass yourself with your brash predictions?

They got whitewashed by a last place team.  Granted Philly is pretty decent
but the "best team in the Cambell Conference" would have beaten a last
place team.

Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry, let me first say that I've been sort of
a Cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly,

good taste:

This is the best he can do?!!  Gee Don, tremendous amounts of professionalism
here.  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with
this nonsense...making fun of names??  It's bad enough that he makes asinine
blanket statements about European players, but he's now resorted to making fun
of their names too?  He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week
when he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em, Sock 'em' video
until he dropped the gloves...

>On the subject of realignment, Don said that he liked the
>new division names.

Well, what he _said_ was that even though he's been around the league for quite
some time, he still doesn't know who's where w.r.t. conference and division
names.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades
or so....he also invited the audience to "Name the teams in the Wales...quick,
quick!" Followed by "Ah, you don't know, I don't know...."  

Sorry Don.  Wrong on this one.

>Ron (to Don): "I don't know wy I like you on your show
>for 30 minutes... I can hardly stand you on this show for 5."

This was absolutely hilarious.

Don's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly
good...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in
the NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he's never been one for objectivity,
has he?

Don's question to Gretzky:

>Wouldn't it be better
>for you to change your friends so that they like the game, than for
>us to change the game for your friends?"

Now this I liked.

To put it mildly.  As I watched the Flyers demolish Toronto last night, 4-0,
I realized that no matter how good the Leafs' #1 line may be, they'll need
one or two more decent lines to go far in the playoffs.  And, of course, a
healthy Felix Potvin.

		With the kind of team Montreal has now,  they can take the
cup easily.  The only problem they have right now is that everyone is
trying to steal the show and play alone.  They need some massive teamwork.
	They are also in a little of a slump because long-time hockey
Montreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it was
rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21
years.  But I know that is no excuse.  But if the Habs manage to get some
good teamwork and get into the spirit,  they should have no problem
winning in May.

   I agree. I also think Roy needs a good kick sometimes...that horrible
4-0 loss to the Capitals last week...yeeeech!

True rumor.  Fact!  A big three way deal!

Eric Lindros going to Ottawa Senators.  And Senators get $15mill from
Montreal.

Montreal gets Alexander Daigle (the first round pick from Senators)

Philly gets Damphousse, Bellow, Patrick Roy and a draft pick.

You know, you're absolutely right.  I think we should round up all those
players of European descent and ship 'em back to where they came from.  Let's
see, with whom should we start?  I dunno, Lemieux?  Hmmm...sounds like he
has *French* blood in him!!!  Hey!  France is part of Europe!  Send that
Euro-blooded boy back!!!

Sheesh.

I don't think it would be hard to find some Native Americans (or Native
Canadians, for that matter) who would dispute your claim to this great 
continent of *ours.*  Ya see, if you believe the anthropologists, we're *all*
immigrants of some sort.  If you really don't think that Mogilny, Bure,
Selanne, et al have improved the NHL, then I'm not sure you understand the
game.

At the Lester Patrick Awards lunch, Bill Torrey mentioned that one of his
options next season is to be president of the Miami team, with Bob Clarke
working for him.  At the same dinner, Clarke said that his worst mistake
in Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go -- in retrospect, almost all
players came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win.  Rumours are
now circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers.

Nick Polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the
Red Wings; After all, Bryan Murray approved it.

Gerry Meehan and John Muckler are worried over the Sabres' prospects;
Assistant Don Lever says that the Sabres have to get their share now,
because a Quebec dynasty is emerging ...

The Mighty Ducks have declared that they will not throw money around
loosely to buy a team.

Oilers coach Ted Green remarked that "There some guys around who can
fill Tie Domi's skates, but none who can fill his helmet."

Senators' Andrew McBain told off a security guard at Chicago Stadium
who warned him of the stairs leading down to the locker room; McBain
mouthed off at him, after all being a seasoned professional ... and
tumbled down the entire steep flight.

I *loved* Dan Kelly!  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back
in 1980 or so.  No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he
wasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice!
No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)

I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the
Bus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll never
forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in
the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net
goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the
story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din
"Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!"  It sounds stupid, but that
early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then
I've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened
by Dan Kelly's passing.  He was one of the good guys.

Re Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be
like without Recchi for 30 games.

Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot
of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring
a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring
ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.

Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42
points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor
in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in
his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as
a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.

My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,
but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest
disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect
coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO
has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any
coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a
bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.

Speaking of spelling errors on the Cup, I wonder if the "h" in

be about spelling Pittsburgh.

Linares has not defected; as I pointed out, MLB requires that the player

What a surprise.  As long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all
teams, MLB won't let a few teams sign it.  Seems perfectly reasonable to
me.

Sheesh.  The rumor mill strikes again.  But let's just assume this were true.
My question is this:

What would Montreal give San Jose if the Sharks got first pick and took Daigle?

These new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules are
MUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count
how many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the
names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, of
course, there will have to be new "sub-positions", like the power center
who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,
and the "shooting defenseman" and the "point defenseman".  Finally, we'll
be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. 
Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to
see Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.

Heard last night that Paul Kuryia will be playing for the Canadian World
Hockey team this year.  He was on a local radio station when a friend of
the familty called to congratulate him on the invitation.  Meekly Paul told
the host that he didn't think they wanted it out yet.  This morning I heard
that he is destined to play on a line with Lindros and Recci{unsure of this
one}.  If he plays well in this arena, he could go #1 or 2 in the draft.

MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba.  They just have to
defect first.  

Sort of like the situation used to be with Russian/Czech/etc hockey
players, until the political situation in those countries changed.

This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned
that the NHL could expand in Europe.

Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing
to play for a team in Europe?

I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily
interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.
(I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)

When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:

- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)
- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.
- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.
- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.

I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:

- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french
  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One
  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could
  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.

Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved
to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league
(2 years ago?)

I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.

Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be 
the best way to do it?

NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should
only be three penalties:

1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.

2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the
   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you
   are thrown out of the game, and fined.

3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot
   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.

Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties
in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,
until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured.

This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.
Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can
take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network
announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and
Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the PA announcer says it.

Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play
cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network
can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told
them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a 
chance of pronouncing his name right.

Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,
for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is
so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting
contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their 
routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods
either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The
game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a
10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.

The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in
commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.
On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch
it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then
it truly is a sad day.

Enough for now.

- Notable team news (transactions and announcements)
 
 Note that this information is culled from press releases and posts.  It 
is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or 
of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two 
postings.
 
 Boston Bruins
  Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden 
finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project 
back on track to be finished in September 1995.
  Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following 
surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back.
**
  Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.

 Buffalo Sabres
1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)
  Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike 
Ramsey.
**
  Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the 
club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion 
Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television 
and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season.
**
  Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of 
American Hockey League.

 Calgary Flames
  Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future 
considerations.
**
  Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt 
Lake City of International Hockey League.

 Chicago Blackhawks
        The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to 
open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's 
Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two 
teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the 
old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, 
located directly across the street, opens.
  Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report 
following a trade with Edmonton.

 Detroit Red Wings
  Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft 
pick.
  Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in 
the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft.
**
  Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall 
of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze 
plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site 
of the Michigan Hall of Fame.

 Edmonton Oilers
  Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug 
Weight.
  Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.
  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with 
Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the 
city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to 
administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner 
Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has 
threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no 
money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat 
Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce 
significant revenues for other owners.
  Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the 
remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.

 Hartford Whalers
  Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.
  Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from 
Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick.
**
  The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center 
from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford 
Whalers franchise in the city.

 Los Angeles Kings
  Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark 
Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick.

 Minnesota North Stars
1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S.
1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada
  The Dallas City Council has approved an agreement with the Minnesota 
North Stars that will bring the NHL club to Reunion Arena next season.
  Defenseman Mark Tinordi, captain of the North Stars, will be sidelined 
the rest of the season, including any postseason games the North Stars 
might play, because of a broken collarbone.
  Acquired defenseman Mark Osiecki from Winnipeg for ninth- and 10th-round 
draft picks in 1993.
  Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota.
  A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North 
Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Green's former executive 
assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described 
her outfits as "very hot" and "very sexy," once slapped her hand as she 
was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it 
through a client's hair.
  The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season, 
announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for 
their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.
  The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it 
wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last 
home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must 
pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992, 
which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take 
property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine.
**
  Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, 
allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two 
regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the 
end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league didn't 
rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars 
recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo, 
Mich., to replace Churla.

 Montreal Canadiens
  Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league 
defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.

  Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta 
Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be 
a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the 
first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six 
goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After 
the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to 
compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East 
Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor 
league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.

  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that 
the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the 
Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning 
general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that 
the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are 
exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But 
Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  "We were disappointed 
with ESPN's irresponsible comment," Esposito said.  "There is just no 
substance to the rumor." Rumors have been swirling for the past two years 
regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to 
build a new arena.

- Draft news:

        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in 
June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one 
goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion 
drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction 
between forwards and defensemen.
        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down 
from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and 
Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.
        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of 
one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is 
that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.
        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises 
will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total 
of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa 
Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two 
new teams.
        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority 
drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst 
records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The 
expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, 
Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.
        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry 
Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new 
teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 
1994.

        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 
1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a 
delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.

        The site for the 75th Memorial Cup Tournament has yet to be 
chosen.  It will be staged in Ontario but the exact location won't be 
determined until next spring.
        In March of '93, the two regular-season division champions from 
the Ontario Hockey League will meet in a best-of-seven series at the start 
of the playoff season.  The winner of the series earns the right to host 
the Memorial Cup, traditionally held in May.
        The eventual OHL champion will also participate in the tourney. 
But if the league champs also happen to be the club hosting the Memorial 
Cup, then the league finalists will advance as well."

  Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early 
November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local 
interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000 
salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players 
are not limited to three years in the league.
  A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93-
94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron 
confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under 
consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking 
games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are 
close to being confirmed as the league's newest members.

 - Major League Hockey
 
        A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States 
and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced 
Wednesday, February 10.
        Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of 
the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New 
Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.
        According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams 
playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have 
been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, 
Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto 
and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.
        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its 
rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''
        Boe said league play will have an international flair and 
discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the 
IIHF.
        ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and 
eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.
        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.

 8. Answers to some frequently asked questions:
 
 Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?
 A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in 
and around Montreal. Hence they were called "Les Habitants" (natives of 
Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.
 
 Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?
 A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to 
signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer 
existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.

 Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?
 A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is 
a weekly journal with up-to-date info.
Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)
Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)
 
 Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in 
the NHL?
 A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 
chances.
 
 Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?
 A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when 
a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a 
+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-
handed goals do count for +/-.
 
 Q: What is the five-hole?
 A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: 
(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower 
right, and (5) five-hole.
 
 Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?
 A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven 
series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a 
game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.

 Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?
 A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever 
to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for 
the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis 
Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat 
Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine 
shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately 
lost the game, 6-4.

 Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?
 A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed 
the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be 
worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 
million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.

 Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?
 A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National 
Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey 
League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as 
assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in 
September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell 
University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.

 Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?
 A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and 
Colonial Hockey Leagues.

Yeah, and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35
minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
best defenseman in the league. I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I
could. (That way, when one got a penalty the others could kill it!)

I'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the
series.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal
(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely
(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one
of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.

Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or
does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!

Final

I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for
6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play
in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear
territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will
not be putting money on this series. :-)

>Patrick Division, semifinal

>Pittsburgh vs. NY Islanders:
>What can I say? The Pens are flying high and have the most talent in

Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent
of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is
credit to NY.

>Washington vs. New Jersey:
>CAPITALS IN 5.

Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent
team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.

>Pittsburgh vs. Washington:
>If the Caps had Bill Ranford I might see an upset, but Don Beaupre
>just doesn't inspire my hopes.  PENGUINS IN 6.

I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't
think it will go six either...*maybe* five.

>CONFERENCE FINAL:
>Pittsburgh vs. Boston:
>A replay of last year. The Penguins are just as good as 12 months ago,
>and the Bruins are much improved. But... PENGUINS IN 6.

If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They
own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once
again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the
Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.

>Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal

>Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota):
> BLACKHAWKS IN 5.

Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,
IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.

>Detroit vs. Toronto:
>The Leafs have had an excellent season, but they've been playing
>playoff hockey all year - the Habs under Burns were the same way and
>always wilted in the playoffs.  RED WINGS IN 5.

Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out
why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three 
at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.

>FINAL:
>Chicago vs. Detroit:
> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT. RED WINGS IN 7.

It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. 
And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.

>Smythe Division SEMI-FINALS:

>Vancouver vs. Winnipeg:
> CANUCKS IN 7.

Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their
size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team
chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.

>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:

This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. 
I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a
non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate
Gretzky.  LA in six.

>FINAL:
>Vancouver vs. Calgary:
> FLAMES IN 6.

If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be
LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.

>COFERENCE FINAL:
>Detroit vs. Calgary:
> RED WINGS IN 7.

Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked
LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.

>STANLEY CUP FINAL:
>Pittsburgh vs. Detroit:

If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet
against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong
because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,
though, I'd have to take the Penguins.

A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than
Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from
the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.
I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while
he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),
Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.
from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best
all-round players in the NHL.

Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political
office, in Northlands, and in the business community that the Oilers
with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on "normal" hockey
revenues and expenses.  That he did this was a good thing...it is better
he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would
truly jeopardize the franchise.

Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell
a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or
via a new building.  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly
what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough.

There are a lot of risks in moving a team also...

...one has to remember "Peter Puck's principle"...it is better to
spend other people's money than one's own if at all possible.

I re-read what I wrote and it didn't say exactly what I thought.  

Sure the Pens are a better team.  They've got size and the best skill players
in the league.  They've also got the best clutch goaltending.  They're the 
best team in the league.

But, my point was the Caps have not played to their ability level vs the
Pens since last year's choke.  And that's the mental problem (the one they've
had for a number of years) I tried to point out.  Spirit, mental preparedness,
will to win, whatever you want to call it, it's missing when the Caps play the
Pens.  Actually, you're right - it won't make any difference.

He's not gone yet.  The position opening is down to Polie and the

  Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, 
allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two 
regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at 
the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league 
didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The 
Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in 
Kalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla.

I watched him over his entire career.  I have NEVER seen a player, and that
includes Russell Courtnall and Davie Keon, screw up as many breakaways as
Bob Gainey.  And I will never forget the time Denis Potvin caught Gainey
with his head down.  You have been sold a bill of goods on Bob Gainey.

Gainey was a plugger.  And when the press runs out of things to say about 
the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa
Tikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek
Sanderson, Wayne Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri

	Here is an update on the Goalie mask poll...
	First, since so many people gave me their 3 best, I decided to
give 3 pts for their favorite, 2 pts for 2nd, 1 for 3rd. If you e-mailed
a response with only one, I gave it 3 pts. Please feel free to send me
your 2 other favorites, if you only sent one before. 
	Also, votes are still welcome! Any mask you like will do, as I 
have received votes for players not in the NHL. Please mention what team
they play for, though.
	So here are the up-to-date results so far:

It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I
can think of.  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  The
contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
same team or different teams.  And yet ... awards are given and promotions
received based in part on these meaningless stats.  The operative words are
"in part" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one
has about the player.  


> To compare Jagr's and Francis's plus/minus is ridiculous and absurd...

And comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd...
but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\-
for Selanne, Lindros, Juneau, Potvin, and the other rookies in the league...
and yet...

How about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game.

The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,
a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri
Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS
never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an
NHL record 9th OT loss this season.

Roster move:

Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill

Injuries:

Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.

Lines:

Eklund-Lindros-Recchi
Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen
Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy
Faust-Acton-Brown

Galley-Bowen
Yushkevich-Hawgood
Carkner-Hynes

Dominic Roussel

Game Summary:

I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts
I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by
a few things I did pick up:

First Period:
	Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51
	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)
Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,
Har (interference) 18:43

Second Period:
	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00
	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09
	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38
Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har
major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,
Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50

Third Period:
	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)
	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11
	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38
Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30

Overtime:
	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.
Penalties - None

Power Play:
	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4

Goalies:
	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)
	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)

On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off.

The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie.

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if
they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play.

That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored, much less how.

From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised
that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy 
Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season
and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????

What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...

#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no
accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey
next season.

#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,
and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't
play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family
has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.

#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season
scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player
get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.
Not a tough choice.

Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line
this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie
mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling
that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come.

Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some
things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
But consistency became a problem for him.

The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning
percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in
Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in
next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as
many goals as they allowed, 319.

The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them.

I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable.

Well, as long as we're being unduly cocky here, It's obvious that the Pens
will cone out of the Patrick Division *not* the Caps, and also that
they will win thier third Stanley Cup. "Collective Wisdom" is a very polite
way of putting it, I don't know if I'd be so gracious.
And, for what it's worth (Probably not much) I think the Habs will come out of
the Adams too.

It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar
and then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,
kept harping about how they "must have had a different view upstairs"
because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who
saw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally 
signalled no goal but the video replay "judges" initiated contact with
the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is
unheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
the Leaf chances this year.

un, you better add at least another plus to the Pederson
for Neely trade, the Bruins also received a number 1 round
draft pick, didn't play great this year but Wesley's still a
decent defenseman....  And the Bruins got Pederson back eventually
anyway.....

Well I just read in the Boston Globe that while not confirming
(or denying) anything, Walsh may end up with the Rangers organizations
as an (assistant Coach?).  Keenan has talked with Walsh in the past
(he came up to see Kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds,
funny I guess he got to watch the Ferraro brothers as well.....) I'm
not sure if walsh will go, but if Keenan is getting 700,000 and walsh
even gets 100,000 that's a 30% pay raise for walsh (not to mention
a nice career move....) Anyone from New York Hear anything about
this????????

Does anyone out there have the shorthanded goal totals of the NHL players
for this season?  We're trying to finish our rotisserie stats and need SHG
to make it complete.

You know... after I finished laughing I thought:  This would be a great
final.  Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry
nonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish.

Of course, I would prefer a Vancouver--Montreal final with Vancouver
scoring the final goal....

Pity neither will happen.

Yes, it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best
hockey markets in the country.  Being a North Stars fan, it is sad to
see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion
at the hands of a truly crappy owner.

Hopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities
within the next five years.  Even if this is the case, a lot has been
lost in the North Stars move...

You think that's bad?  I'm in Bowling Green, OH, and we get ABC from
Toledo.  Well, the cable co. decided to totally pre-empt the game (no tape
delay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon!  Hockey is very big around here,
too.  I had to listen to "my" Penguins win on my car radio out in the
parking lot.  I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230
miles from Pittsburgh, the reception usually isn't good at all.  I can't
believe I picked it up during the middle of the day.

Well I don't see any smileys here.  I am trying to figure out if the poster
is a dog or a wordprocessor.  Couldn't be neither.  Both are smarter than
this.

How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty
good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the
deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the 
Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they 
lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping
Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for
the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

Over 84 games, Gretzky's total projected 226 points.

The 29-30 Bruins had a .875 winning percentage.
Also the 77-78 Canadiens had a .806 percentage with a 59-10-11 record.

Does anybody know the details of the Shriners All-Star game that featured the
best seniors in college hockey in a game in Orono, Maine?  If you do, please
reply.



Aargh!

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL.
He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques.
The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!

It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous
goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau
was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the
last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were
caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned
the other cheek...BASTARD!

Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have
gone in.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the loss on Stewart.  The Habs had
plenty of chances to capitalize, Muller, LeClair, Haller, etc. but
failed to put the puck in the net.  That's what did them in.  But
Mr. Stewart didn't help matters at all.

Oh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)

Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell 
from the twin cities? In an earlier post, it was announced that Norm 
Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena. 
Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?

Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board, 
the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large
piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which 
they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains.

Actually, Messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries...
Keenan and Messier have always gotten along...Keenan dumped Steve
Yzerman from the last Canada Cup team, even though Yzerman had
endured the training camp, when Messier who had missed essentially the
entire camp recovering from injuries became available at the

People are seeming to be less concerned about Kariya's size as he leads

on left wing with Eric Lindros and Mark Recchi at the world

Not in Indiana:  they showed a tape-delay of Chicago v Boston, because
WGN had the rainout of the cubs.  So WGN showed reruns of Hitchcock.
No hockey (at least in this part of the state).

Sorry, my memory is gone. I thought that O'Neill got sent back

this says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of
their top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since January.

Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall.
Gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck.

If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as Gainey was, then yeah,
I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing "technically" smart 
hockey.  In any case, to claim as Greg did, that Gainey *never* made 
a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.

Good for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to

I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at 
all.

Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is
simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go 
around.  Who would you rather have as your "checking" centre?  Doug
Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky
or Mario as my "checking" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover
Bob Gainey? 

>any team.  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their

You're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the
best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If 
Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he 
should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen-
sively.

Settle down?  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel
prize then I suggest that you had best "settle down".  And if you are
going to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you "settle 
down" before you bother following up on my postings.

Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking
wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.

The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe.
(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions get
promoted and the worst get demoted).

Would European fans put up with our "if you've paid, you can play" 
attitude??

How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based 
corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a good
product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's
record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).

If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybe
teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth 
division).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like
Halifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would 
eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within
its own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventually
get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the
league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
of newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can
dream, can't I??)

Look at British (or any European) soccer as an example (they never have fan
problems).

Just someone who thinks our system really sucks

Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.
They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities. 

When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing 
apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't 
very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of
him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of
player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of
players- this includes defensive forwards.

When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being
a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.

Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better
defensive forward, but he wasn't.

Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.

First,Happy Birthday,Val. Second, ESPN's affinity with Patrick has probably
more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey

Gary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew

Smythe (who cares?)

	Cal vs. LAK - Cal in 5 (LA sucks!!!!!!!!! IMO)

Division finals
	Bos vs. Que - Bos in 7 (killer games, watch for Cam to shine)

	Chi vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Tor defense finally get it together)
	Cal vs. Win - Cal in 6 (Win too tired after 1st series)

Conference finals
	Pit vs. Bos - Bos in 6 (Pit too beat up by NJD to play (I hope))
	Cal vs. Tor - Tor in 6 (Vernon turns into a sieve)

Stanley Cup
	Bos vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Two totally different teams, who knows? Dreams

As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,
trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through
for the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will
have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can
kill them.

I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,
are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as
possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks
and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.

Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...

#1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season:	11th
Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		P (D)

It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that
featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and
'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing
grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this
year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would
not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.

But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first
ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.
As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.

#30	JEFF HACKETT		Season: 3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft
Grade:		C

Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply
wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,
almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save
percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to
bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry
the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early
injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,
but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next
year.

#31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie)
Acquired:	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent
Grade:		I (A-)

It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the
incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary
Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started
the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'
owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP
honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he
tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs
Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up
all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can
share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor
Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he
may not ever.

#32	ARTURS IRBE		Season:	1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B+

I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that
he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has
provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting
the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.
He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and
making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the
goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do
with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for
a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named
as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.

Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the
game and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it?
There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field. I'm sure
you'd be of great help to, say, the Leafs as an assistant coach or
a scout. Or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator...
 
I might be wrong, of course, and you already have.

How many players of international class an average NHL team has. 6-10?
Top players just play more in smaller rinks. Is the quality of European hockey
really poor, then recent years only few north-american (usually good farm 
players) players have got place in Finnish league or Elitserien, while most 
have been shipped back.

The new name is Florida Panthers.  
The panther is an endangered species, mostly located in the Everglades.
A couple of years ago, there were license plates made with Panthers on
them (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund).

The name of the new President of the Panthers should be announced today.

As of yesterday's paper, Huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at
the Miami Arena this fall.  The team has a guaranteed two-year lease with
the arena, with four one-year options that could run through 1999.

"It's not our choice", James Blosser, a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said
about ruling out the arena as a long term option.  "The NHL told us we 
can't stay there.  It's not economically feasible."

One reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox
and advertising revenue at the arena, reducing the hockey team's profit
potential.

The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward, Dade, 
and Palm Beach counties.

A leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium, where residents
10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena, ending
an eight-year battle of wills.

Compliments of the News/Sun-Sentinel.

Jim G.

"Fitz...Sanchez...Castranova..."



As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president.
After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill
Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.

A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_
Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as 
persident and general manager of the New York Islanders.
Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become
as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.

The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price 
information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the
day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and
GM.

The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team
to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida
Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National 
Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.

"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats," Torrey said.  
"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice."

More BIO:
In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders
in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four
consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight
seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president
of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-
offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.

"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick", said Torrey, 58, a
native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm
Beach.

What, did you leave the room each of the 100 or so times they said that
there WERE NO OTHER NIGHT BASEBALL GAMES? Every break they took back at
the studio mentioned it, followed by 'so...we're gonna show you hockey
instead.' My wife and I are hoping for rain at every baseball game they

Point is, be glad they showed hockey, but if baseball was available
anywhere else you can bet you would've watched baseball last night.

(Detroit, April 19)

In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the Detroit Redwings
scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. 

The Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior
Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating of
Andy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on
the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior 
visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the Wings by the league's best 
team.

If I'm not mistaken, San Jose had more wins than Ottawa. First tiebreaker in

Us easterners who have newspapers with editors
unsympathetic to playoff pools, often don't get
summaries from west coast games since they
finish too late at night for the morning edition.

I (and I'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate
it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games
could be posted to this group right away.
basically, all we need are goal scorers and assists,
don't bother with times, penalties, shots etc...

this would make a lot of pool-obsessed people very
happy.

I guess with the Senators out golfing now, the 
local papers have lost interest.  ;-)

It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European
vacation this spring...

Ranford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson
are playing for Canada.

Podein and Weight are playing for the US.

Is Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging
injuries late in the season.

Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to
play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov,
and Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not
the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly
in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the

All of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said
that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.
If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup
by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim
and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.
But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM
so none of this is true anyway.

I was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive
evidence that the puck _did_ cross the line.  And, the replays I saw showed 
fairly conclusively that the puck did _not_ cross the goal line at any
time anyway.  Somebody screwed up.

There's quite a few Wings fans lurking about here, they just tend
to be low key and thoughtful rather than woofers.  I suppose every
family must have a Roger Clinton, though.  But remember (to paraphrase
one of my favorite Star Trek lines), "if we adopt the ways of the Leaf

There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players.
The "whole Russian strategy" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano,
who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade 
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most
notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with
Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will 
necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates
for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a 
great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly
to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by 
injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered).

Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the 
league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.

No, Caleb, it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with;
it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN
left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds
from CBC (-;).  It's the amount of hockey they're showing, or lack
of it, that we're complaining about.  They had rights to two OT's
that could've been shown on Sunday night after baseball ... and
they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed
by Super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, I was checking in
desperation for Canucks-Jets) last night after SportsCenter.

Francis got 101 in 89-90, his last full season with Hartford.

In agreement with your previous post, I think Francis is a tremendous and
generally underrated complete player.  I would LOVE to have him here in a
Capitals uniform where he would certainly be the #1 center (even though
Pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated).
Francis impresses me in many ways as an "ethical Dale Hunter".  Tons of
heart and can-do attitude with a lot of different skills, but none of
the cheap shots and few penalty minutes.  Not to mention nearly always
coming through when it's important.

Hello Hockey fans.
Bonjour tout le monde!

Well, in Salt Lake City this past Sunday, the local ABC station decided not
to televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!
Anyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can
not find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing
everything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.

I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now
that ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to
pull in
three games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am
not sure.

IF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to
telent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.

Thanks in advance
Merci d'avance

P.S.  Anglais ou francais d'accord.

What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and
I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there
is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits
Pat Burns.

If you were Pat Burns what would you do?

Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage
to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments
on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic
idea...

Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against 
the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success
will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have
any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the
hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples
skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.
He used to be good at it.  We need him now.  

Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.
I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.
These guys are the "swing" players for the Wings.  Last year they
did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick
exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour
should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a
nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  
Score Gilmour score!

Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??
	      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line
	      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)

* as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up
		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,
		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their
		checking line against these "finesse" players - well then
		let them play.

** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.
** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.
** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).

I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and
out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending
or officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.

                           The Rose Garden

 9:58 A.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's
an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the
winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the
Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell
that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win
a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.

     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to
win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to
cheer them onto victory.

     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in
size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can
understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.
In our state people are still talking about the time we won the
Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was
back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine
will as proud of this team as they are today.

     You know, in my state football is a slightly more
popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)
But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I
can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came
here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does
have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish
we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)

     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In
the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority
Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior
Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm
actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger
than me.

     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done
a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship
game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I
know a little bit about.

     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams
and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and
Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine
must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a
team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from
behind.

     I think it's important, as I ask young people from
around America who have achieved outstanding things in working
together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and
appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values
and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all
of our lives.

     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have
them here today.  (Applause.)

     (The President is presented with team jersey.)
(Applause.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.
(Applause.)

     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)

                             * * * * * *

     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco
this morning, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney
General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions
to her and to the FBI.

     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it
should be executed?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.
That was their judgment, the FBI.

     Q  Is this a raid?

     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --
talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be
done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical
decisions.

     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this
morning?

     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my
quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).

     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator
Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.

     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen
this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to
have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to
talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and
talk some more.

     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your
compromise is no compromise.

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator
Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for
the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research
indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28
emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan
and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those
purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people
back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you


can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position
they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year
deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time
and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got
to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their
position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this
kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to
work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.
We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good
about it.

     THE PRESS:  Thank you

                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT

The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year.  I had the Rangers
on MSG, and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time.  Yes,
I'd rather have SC cover it, just for the amount of coverage.

I think Thorne earns his money.  The best part is that he is the same way when 
he is earning his $$ from SportsChannel as the Devils announcer (i.e.,
unbiased).  He goes orgasmic for goals, despite which team scores, and even more 
excited (if possible) for great saves.  He did a good job of explaining certain 
things to non-hockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport
(unlike NBC's clowns for the ASG).

      Don't any of you Pittsburgh fans tell me how Mike Lang(e) is better. 
      Maybe if he were a little spontaneous, rather than reading rehearsed
      lines of B.S having nothing to do with hockey he would be better.

	It's not really crap you know... only half crap ;-)   From what i 
understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border... 
(actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the
equipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in
about 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  In the states, where ice time
is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare 
this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do...
And this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the US are majority white...

BTW: what was the original question... i think it has to do with the Hispanic
communtiy and playing hockey....

Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. 
A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear
with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as 
getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd
have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also
have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are
different.

Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again. (I am
starting to sound like Roger or what?)

I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great
GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you
gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue
back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-
that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better 
than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original
post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not
the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:

>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent
>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.

I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here
which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for 
us to say, "He should hire a different coach."  In fact, he has talked about
doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so
built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of
the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to 
prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second
round.  He needs to, as the papers say, "get that monkey off his back."
So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish
to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all
a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down
from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will
improve as a result.

I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent
on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how
good of a GM he really is.

>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM
>so none of this is true anyway.

I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing
it with you.

Roger? Lecture someone on not using smileys? What sweet hipocracy...

KOZ

LETS GO CAPS!!



Here are the standings after game 1 of each of the divisional semi-finals.
(Hey, look who's #4!)  I'll try to post the standings after "each game"
(i.e. every two days).

I managed to recover the email lost up to Saturday night, so all I'm missing
is mail that arrived between early Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon.
Many people re-sent their teams, so you may have received two replies back
from me.  If your team name is not on this list, please resend your team
to me and I'll see what I can do.  Any kind of "proof" you sent it on the
weekend will help your case.  :-)  Seriously, this is only a fun pool and
I trust each person to be honest.

Again, sorry for any inconvenience, and I hope the pool is still fun for you.

Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got
some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
sports news, "There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City,
and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ..." when you
know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ...

>If people want hockey on TV, they should watch hockey on TV. I bet

From today's Times, ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St. Louis (a
4.2), and the Kings-Flames got a 2.9 on the West Coast, but only a 2.2
in metro New York (i.e., the Devils squandered their newfound support
from a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;).  In comparison,
Seniors Golf did better ...

>Next week, there will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey.

I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...
I can't tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not, 'cos I don't
watch much TV ... the NHL should have made sure that it was solid
on cable before going on the air.  Even ESPN could've sold second
rights to third party systems (i.e., non-SportsChannel) since they
are not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey
fans will not necessarily be watching pre-season beach volleyball
if playoffs games aren't being shown somewhere ...

Hi all,

Due to living in the Bay Area, I as unable to see Vancouver's victory over
the Jets last night.  I know the score, but that rarely describes the game.
Could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht happened.  How well
did each team play?  Were the cannucks deserving of the victory?

Also, could some kind soul please email me the end of season, individual
player stats?

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a
certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the
gate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row.

Ha!  Such humor!  They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of
them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical,
much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when
they play pathetically.

Soderstrom plays with Philly, but he doesn't have a moulded mask.
He's got the helmet and cage variety, in white.  Or at least that's
what he wore thirteen hours ago.

Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out
Vanbiesbrouck's mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect
of:
"You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask 
and he can't stop a beachball!"

You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard
it.

I think Ed Belfour has the current best mask in the NHL btw.  I also like
Moog's, and I'll give Fuhr's new one an honourable mention, although I haven't
seen it closely yet (it looked good from a distance!).  What's also neat is
Chevaldae's in Detroit; they call him "Chevy" so he has two checkered flags
painted at the top as in an auto race.

Did they move Probert back to defense?  Why did I see him parking his ass
in front of Potvin all night?  Somebody is going to have to discipline
Probert if the Leafs want to win the series.  Perhaps a fresh Clark should
hit the ice at the end of a long Probert shift and straigten him out for
a while...

 It's the "opening-game effect" maybe. Pros arrive late, nervousness for
 rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things
 hard to get it going against these "worse" nations.
 I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better
 it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.

 Some other reasons why the "worse" teams are so tough to beat was presented
 by Hans "Virus" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).

 1) The "worse" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)
    have now usually world class goalies.

 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much
    less unnecessary penalties.

 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them "run out of gas."

 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

 OK, I forgot the Czech roster at home yesterday, but now I have it.
 I don't know the teams for all players, so I would appreciate if
 you guys could fill in the blanks for me (especially I think some
 of these players play in Finland).

Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled it
at a game in Boston.  

It was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The "Golden Triangle"
(Pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along
with a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the 
other.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo (the really
fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens
logo, and a space for the "new" (now current) logo.

Tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it
for him.  

But while wearing the mask, the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The
very next game, Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask
done in by a goalie's superstition.

  Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to
  flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than
  Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
  hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
  plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
  time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out
  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
  against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would
  much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus 
on the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to '52
at the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team (I think) to sweep 
the cup in 8 games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats
than from the old Olympia balcony, though.

Funniest I ever saw was when some Tiger fans threw one on the field
during a Detroit/Toronto baseball game ...  I was living in California
and the folks I was watching with had never heard of hockey and were 
incredulous when I recognized the octopus BEFORE the camera closeup !!

        Well as for team captains being traded
        in there first year in the NHL the
        Edmonton Oilers traded their captain
        Ron Chiperfield to the Quebec Nordique
        right at the trading deadline for 
        Goaltender Ron Lowe
        In their second year of existence
        The Edmonton Oilers again right at the trade 
        deadline traded their captain, this time 
        B.J. McDonald to the Vancouver Canucks
        along with the rights to winger Ken 
        Berry for Garry Lariviere and the rights 
        to Lars Gunner Petterson 
        
        as for more captain trivia, the next Edmonton
        captain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
        the Buffalo Sabres, after him was Wayne Gretzky
        who was traded to L A, then came Kevin Low who
        only this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
        so that every captain the Edmonton Oilers have had
        has been traded.

        The present captain is Craig McTavish and we'll
        just have to wait and see.


        well talk to you later

        Steve

   Hi there, I can't seem to get mail to you. Can you tell me your entire
adress, or even your dotted decimal address?

   (ie. 131.202.3.10)

I think that they go to divisional records before goals, but I could be
wrong, too.

The law is much worse than worthless.  It gives police the power to put
innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't
understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the
difference between a core file and classified military secrets.

There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something
is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the
user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No
one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.

What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to
provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester
or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most
people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.

As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they
insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came
from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it
in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.

As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,
without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random
bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is
pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.

If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,
because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to
look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If
enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.

When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's
just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're
sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will
burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.

<8.1> What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?

  Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites
  is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who
  has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment. 
  Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses 
  (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.
 
  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk
  remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):
  pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX
  scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to
  aid remailer use).

  ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu

  hh@pmantis.berkeley.edu
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer.  Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.

  nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu 
  ----------------------
    Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by
    Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.

  phantom@mead.u.washington.edu 
  -----------------------------
    Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site
    address for information.

  Notes
  =====
  
  - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
    running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues
    are wholly unresolved.
  
  - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP
    software (see the question on cryptography). 

  - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)
    vary between sites.

  - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are
    mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.

_____
<8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?

  
  Users
  -----

  - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the
    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.
  - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.
  - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
    Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.
  - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.
    Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases
    network traffic.
  - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this
    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'
    hierarchy is preferred.
  - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.
    references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for
    readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any
    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
    future ones under the same handle.
  - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your
    identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by
    sending anonymized mail to yourself.
  - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. 
    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.
  - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.
  - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.
    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.
  - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large
    amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating
    his hardware, all for your convenience.

  Operators
  ---------

  - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
    introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and
    consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and
    monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and
    security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or
    lassaiz-faire?
  - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user
    is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user
    posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your
    users trust you to protect them.
  - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations
    where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.
    warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke
    the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)
  - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.
    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly
    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with
    users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under
    ``(in)stability of anonymity''.
  - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?
    What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is
    your commitment to it?
  - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an
    address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. 
    Consult a lawyer about your liability.
  - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared
    to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you
    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system
    adminstrator, consult those who do and are.
  - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If
    possible, query group readers.
  - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message
    format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure
    the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.
  - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from
    physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.

  Readers
  -------
  
  - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason
    that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that
    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail
    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its
    volume is heavy or increasing).
  - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters
    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate
    responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.
  - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,
    harassment, extortion, etc.
  - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they
    offend you personally.
  - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the
    idea of anonymity itself.
  - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings
    should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or
    `conceivable' need exists.

<8.3> How do I `kill' anonymous postings?

  James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:

  > Try putting this in your kill file:
  >   
  >   /Anon/h:j
  >   /Anonymous/h:j
  > 
  > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that
  > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't
  > kill followups. 
  
  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask
  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so
  far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common
  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.
  
_____
<8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?

  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for
  individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is
  almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion
  and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack
  started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was
  wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)
  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided
  anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up
  the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous
  alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through
  servers like there's no tomorrow.''
  
  Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in
  researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste
  <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system
  from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the
  server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,
  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by
  multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended
  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group
  support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was
  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' 
  K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an
  anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus
  against it. 

  K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to
  `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and
  used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of
  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his
  server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to
  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the
  facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was
  created.''

  In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most
  controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on
  scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized
  mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine
  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide
  accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.
  
  J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet
  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological
  opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).
  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,
  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than
  ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of
  anonymity is also controversial.

  For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb
  1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate
  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via
  anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been
  posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then
  non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a
  New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of
  vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating
  through many newsgroups. 
  
  The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded
  that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''
  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was
  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of
  the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived
  association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries
  for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous
  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his
  detractors.

  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal
  opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news
  operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire
  extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the
  scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is
  best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users
  in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a
  day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized
  through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due
  to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to
  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.

  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to
  dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste
  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate
  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages
  originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to
  threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several
  times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it
  by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5
  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the
  service's administration. In response to the serious threats he
  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and
  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.
  
  Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by
  ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security
  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is
  currently in the process of code development and testing. He is
  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon
  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new
  system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple
  email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,
  etc.

  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.
  1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography
  in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of
  confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public
  access account, and he had to shut it down after only several
  weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately
  originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the
  software to the public domain.

  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on
  government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and
  group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the
  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,
  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable
  digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in
  the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to
  attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing
  easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and
  encryption.

  is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on
a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be
retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the
data.

The right way to do communications security is to generate a random
session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy
it. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt
recordings of the conversation.

To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you
have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does
this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over
the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness
plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'
voices.

A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd
never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key
would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation,
and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still
not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the
session keys have been destroyed.

I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones
(the STU-III) must work. Neat, eh?

Without real technical details, it's hard to answer this question. But
suppose they already *are* XORing the two 40-bit parts to produce only
40 bits of real key material? Maybe they're using the exportable version
of RC2...? :-)

Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject
in this post), the name "Clipper Chip" seems very confusable with the
"Clipper" chip of Intergraph.

Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor, Clipper was
a 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations,
notably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools. Intergraph
acquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National
Semiconductor several years back.

When I first saw "Clipper Chip" in the announcement, I immediately
thought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know.

This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue, but then I'm not a
lawyer. I'd say I'm a cryptologist, but I don't want to incriminate
myself under the laws of the new regime.

If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the
encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors
from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government-
installed "back door."  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long
as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government
chips.

(It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad
turns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide
their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacy
is still possible.  But the wording of several passages in the announcement
makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true.)

My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret :

   The chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard.   There will
   be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this
   chip, like it or not.

   If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the 
   access to escrowed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort 
   would make "compatible crypto chips for which no key had been
   escrowed".  This is likely what the release was refering to when 
   they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the
   security of the escrow system.

Let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
escrow houses.  Let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is
the ACLU and the other is the EFF.  (And I'm not entirely joking about
those two names)

In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this
system.  Indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the
current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody
with an old TV can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed
as an "oh goody" step upwards.

And look at how tolerant the public is.  They're willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now.

It was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's
just an ECPA violation.  This would stop that.  All tapping would need
a warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses.

Hey, it's better than the status quo.

I am far less worried about "the feds" tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls.

It would be stupid to rely on even a "Clipperized" channel for truly 
sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
guard against casual eavesdropping.  For example, even with my strong "right 
to bear arms" view of the private right to possess and use strong 
cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that I would 
actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular 
phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  As long as it's only used for mass-market 
voice scrambling, I actually don't see a problem with it.

If you want more security than it offers, use something different.  Use PKCS 
for electronic mail, CELP over DES or triple DES with Diffie-Hellman key 
exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.

And yes, I'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...

* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?


* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?

  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a
  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of
  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of
  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the
  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that
  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption
  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key
  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext
  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to
  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.

* What is an attack?

  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method
  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their
  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out
  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state
  mathematically what this means. Here we go.

  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,
  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.

  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an
  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that
  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have
  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this
  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).

  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at
  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and
  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible
  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other
  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions
  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).

  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if
  n = 2, and so on.

* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?

  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.
  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this
  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem
  is strong!''

  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely
  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is
  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against
  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as
  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this
  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist
  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement
  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that
  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.

  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical
  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions
  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can
  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used
  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.

  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst
  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to
  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,
  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.
  
* Why is the one-time pad secure?

  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the
  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)
  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive
  or) of K and P.

  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial
  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform
  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform
  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,
  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,
  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and
  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of
  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also
  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is
  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p
  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus
  a fortiori A is trivial.)

  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used
  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial
  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be
  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';
  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''

* What's a ciphertext-only attack?

  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is
  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about
  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some
  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial
  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given
  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.

  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can
  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply
  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use
  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no
  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which
  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.
  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is
  a nontrivial attack.

* What's a known-plaintext attack?

  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,
  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.
  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption
  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the
  other decryption P_2.

  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature
  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the
  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him
  decrypt further messages.

* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?

  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical
  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the
  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into
  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a
  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and
  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured
  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of
  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''

  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption
  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a
  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.

  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:
  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as
  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew
  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash
  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.

* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?

  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some
  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're
  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find
  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).

  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed
  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results
  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial
  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many
  possible keys.

* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?

  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys
  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to
  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which
  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English
  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much
  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.

  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its
  entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information''
  of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within
  2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is
  the probability of key K.

FAQ for sci.crypt, part 6: Public-Key Cryptography

This is the sixth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are
mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.
We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.
Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.

every 21 days.


Contents:

* What is public-key cryptography?
* What's RSA?
* Is RSA secure?
* How fast can people factor numbers?
* What about other public-key cryptosystems?


* What is public-key cryptography?

  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and
  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext
  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some
  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so
  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed
  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.
  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie
  and Hellman in 1976.

  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to
  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than
  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,
  and you don't have to worry about spies.

  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an
  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,
  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the
  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.

* What's RSA?

  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and
  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at
  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.

  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples
  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,
  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We
  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.

  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as
  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair
  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a
  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.

* Is RSA secure?

  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.
  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization
  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to
  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that
  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by
  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,
  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to
  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and
  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative
  results.''

* How fast can people factor numbers?

  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra
  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three
  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;
  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The
  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a
  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers
  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in
  any case.

  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple
  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n
  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,
  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100
  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.

  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few
  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are
  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from
  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number
  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic
  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)

* What about other public-key cryptosystems?

  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.
  But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which
  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be
  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want
  to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the
  books and journal articles listed in part 10.

Contents:

* What is a one-way hash function?
* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?
* What are MD4 and MD5?
* What is Snefru?


* What is a one-way hash function?

  A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and
  produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally
  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't
  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not
  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also
  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the
  same hash.

  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an
  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash
  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are
  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user
  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,
  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the
  signature can do the same thing.

  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.

* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?

  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a
  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which
  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it
  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption
  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have
  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1
  if and only if X = H(M).

  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private
  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the
  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.
  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public
  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,
  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.

  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to
  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real
  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key
  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend
  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing
  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.

* What are MD4 and MD5?

  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.
  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is
  available from [FTPMD].

  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft
  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some
  people refer to it as MD5.

* What is Snefru?

  Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph
  Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.
  Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from
  [FTPSF].

* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?

  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It
  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40's, and
  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is
  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,
  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the
  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of
  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many
  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break
  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national
  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.

  Bamford's book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of
  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the
  difference between public and private research in cryptography:

  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,
  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted
  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged
  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of
  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10
  years has there in fact been widespread open research in
  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts
  between these two research communities. Open research is common
  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open
  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in
  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with
  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,
  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can
  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might
  undermine the effectiveness of his own government's code-breakers?
  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would
  force all governments to behave like Stimson's `gentlemen', but one
  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with
  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most
  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have
  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in
  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which
  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.''

* What are the US export regulations?

  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control
  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export
  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by
  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office
  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized
  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule
  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent
  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see
  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.

  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting
  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what
  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which
  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to
  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in
  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at
  least heard of the ITAR.

* What is TEMPEST?

  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer
  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that
  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at
  quite a distance and with little effort.

  Needless to say, encryption doesn't do much good if the cleartext
  is available this way.

* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?

  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for
  corrections.)

  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas
  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass
  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving
  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the
  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.
  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;
  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the
  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;
  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.

  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various
  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:

  The Beale Cypher Association
  P.O. Box 975
  Beaver Falls, PA 15010

  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the
  line:

  send index

  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.
  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher
  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,
  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)

  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of
  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI
  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.
  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this
  string couldn't appear by chance, but feels there must be an
  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this
  string.

* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?

  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis
  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with
  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram'' includes
  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in
  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,
  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.

  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;
  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent
  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.

* Is RSA patented?

  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.
  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been
  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral
  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information
  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of
  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as
  ``should RSA be patented?'', which often flooded sci.crypt and other
  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.

* What about the Voynich manuscript?

  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the
  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list
  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>

  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich

  There's all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of
  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn's
  "The Codebreakers" gives a good introduction.

Well, almost.... If I only had to solve the problem for myself, and were
willing to have to type in a second password (the secret key) whenever I
logged in, it could work. However, I'm trying to create a solution that
anyone can use, and which, once installed, is just as effortless to start up
as the non-solution of just using xhost(1) to control access. I've got
religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers.

Thanks for the pointer! It was good reading, and I liked the idea of using
several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function. However, unless I
missed something, the only source they suggested (aside from a hardware RNG)
that seems available, and unguessable by an intruder, when a Unix is
fresh-booted, is I/O buffers related to network traffic. I believe my
solution basically uses that strategy, without requiring me to reach into
the kernel.

I heard about this solution, and it sounded good. Then I heard that folks
were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this, on
reasonably-configured workstations. I'm not willing to add that much delay
to someone's login process. My approach (etherfind|compress, skip 10K) takes
a second or two to run. I'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of
solutions, that launches the MD5, and simultaneously tries to suck bits off
the net, and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it can't get 10K
after compression before MD5 finishes, use the MD5. This way I could have
guaranteed good bits, and a deterministic upper bound on login time, and
still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds.

Under the relevant federal law, 18 USC sec. 2518(8)(d), the
authorizing judge must notify the targets within 90 days after the tap
period (with extensions) expires.  This is the "normal" practice.

Of course, no wiretap law would be complete without the Unless Clause,

A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available
for anonymous ftp.

"agrep 2.0.4" -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool

source code project available from:

cs.arizona.edu 

in directory "agrep"

agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous
number of powerful search options.  The one most obviously
applicable to cryptography (key selection) is to be able to
specify the "similarity" of matches in the data.

For example say you make up a password/phrase of "qimwe7l".
Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not
in any dictionary or word list.  But how *close* is it to
en entry that could be varied by some "crack" program to
brute-force search for it?

You use agrep to find out.  Looking with argument for none,
one or two errors, no matches.  Good so far.  But 

agrep -3 "qimwe7l" bigwordandphraselist

finds that the pattern "qimwe7l" is too close to the
pattern "imsel" (part of "himself" and a host of others),
to be of any cryptographic value as a key.

An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of
letters like "teh" for "the".  A minimally acceptable password
would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately
ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password.
(In real cryptographic use, my personal passphrases clear at
*least* level 8 on my rather large [>80 meg] word and phrase lists.)


And for searching for key words in human-typed data (lots o'
typos) the tool is unexcelled.  For example, For example,
say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's
SF book "Neuromancer" in the huge SF-Lover's archives.
Even with an error distance specification as small as
of "1" I will find all those people who think the title
was "Necromancer" or other common typos.  Why miss anything?

Also, the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL
at Boyer-Moore (sublinear) speeds.  Great for a NSA wannabe
to look for your name, terrorists names, special Tagalog or
religious words, etc. in the news or e-mail spool directories.

You can even search for ciphertext by using, say, 30,000
random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that
don't score the X chi-square 'birthday' hits on message size Y.

You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing
the pattern on you?  No problem.  Try agrep -p NSA to find
NSA, National Security Agency, NSecAg, No Such Agency,
National Scrabble Association, N*S*A, etc.

You can also specify "fixed" areas: looking for license
plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct,
you might say:

agrep -2 <XYZ>123 licenseplatedatabase

will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors
(addition, substitution, deletion) in the number area.  You can
also "weight" the relative "cost" for substiutions, additions,
or deletion errors.  For example, when searching DNA patterns
for a particular protein combination, you might know that
some kinds of damage cause the "A" nucelotide to drop out more
than other errors... you could adjust for this bias by setting
-Dc where you set the "deletion cost" to count as "c" errors.

A steganographic use (I even used "agrep -2 "<steg>eograp" E"
just now to find the correct spelling!) would be to intentionally
introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext
and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe.  Lots of
possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext...

Also with agrep's powerful extraction options it makes it easy
to abstract the "hits" into a useful form.  For example,

agrep -d "^From" 'PGP;(passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA)'

says output the entire mail record, delimited by 'From'
that contains 'PGP' and contains either 'passphrase',
'Zimmerman', or 'NSA'.

And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster
than the second-best similarity tool publicly available.

As usual, I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs
to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they cannot do
an anonymous FTP.

Get this now.
It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA.

I change login passwords every couple of months.  I sure would suck if I had
to get a new sparc station everytime I wanted to do this.  It seems that this
is what they expect you to do if you want to routinely change your password
on your phone.  I'm sure the government contractor doesn't mind, but a system
where you can cheaply change keys (DES) has inherent security advantages, 
regardless of the algorithms involved.

From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip 
system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key 
management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system 
unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place
at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in 
their data base?

This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key 
algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is 
rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making
chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds
are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that 
could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.   

As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they 
need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont 
have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they
talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but
carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.
They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without 
court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on 
their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?
I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways
possible.

Umm...  I beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''.
The SDNS protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple
encryption systems, as does PEM.  (And I'd love to see how they'd
mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it....)

Mind you, I'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be
used -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them, which
certainly casts doubt on your choice of words.

Hear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to
establish alternatives to the government's Clinton Clipper. As Brad
Templeton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in
enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*
standard, and it will become the "market* standard as well. (There is
a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is
mandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)

(There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will
be to make "workalikes" which meet the standard but which generate
phony or untappable keys...I'm sure the next several weeks will see
these issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)

Meanwhile, I'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security's reaction.
Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual
complaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the
general issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*
ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What's a mere
licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who
wanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of
RSA's patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA
would make tons of money and be happy, I'm sure. A small price to pay.
For those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I'm sure the actual terms
could be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,
it's a small price to pay.)

Strong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of
keys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,
all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is
*NOT* strong crypto!

Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of
patenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in
comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note
that I said "potential"...we'll presumably learn more in the coming
months).

The RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and
attacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no
deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).

I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems
using off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and
CELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and
Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined
with Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative
to the Clipper system.

Of course, we don't really know if the Administration proposes to
outlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping
terrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted
if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child
pornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a
few criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox
mode.)

I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had
with RSA (and don't look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully
legal copy of "MailSafe"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.

RSA?, Jim?, are you listening?

-Tim May

P.S. I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn
out that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal.

This way to detect pre-encryption may be defeated ; one can do  
transformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some 
pre-arranged (in the beginning of communication) function.
I think so. Say, you can do FFT of your encrypted signal.
Just thinking ...

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Congress??  So we're playing politics before we talk to CPSR, academia,
the public, internet users?  I`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down 
democracy?? [Just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]

Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about
     the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]

     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); 

They'll just provide an easily-compromised version to JQ Public.

                         nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  

Maybe we need a CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment.

                                                  There is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Why repeat themselves?  It appears to some (and the story looks pretty
convincing to me, too) that the Justice Department stole a case-tracking
system, modified it, and distributed it to "friendly" police and suchlike
agencies around the world, eg. the Canadian Mounties.  Of course, I have 
no doubt they swore Scout's Honor that there were no backdoors.

With that kind of intelligence, who'd want to be swamped with terabytes

Whether paid off, just gullible, or what, doesn't really matter.

It might also be possible that the NSA / whoever has had the idea for
this for quite a while, has been promoting it (Denning, et al) and
siezed the new opportunity - a new administration who wants to spend
more money on espionage than Bush did.

Whatever, i'm not so sure that the cause/effect order is totally
obvious.

It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost 
irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for
me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good
(or as bad) as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc.

It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER 
MANUFACTURED - after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that
will ever be manufactured. The key depositories can be as secure and
incorruptible as they wish to be, nobody cares anyway...:-(

Now if someone would convince me that the shipping docks of VTI, ATT and
others are impenetrable (remember: the chips have to ship with the key - 
you or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually)
I'd be a bit happier. But do we really believe that the various governments
(including ours) won't have the full lists of all the keys ever manufactured?

Did I miss something here?

My own opinions, quite obviously...

I am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things
seem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.
The all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what
I have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)
agree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it
almost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse
IMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.

I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be
expanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored
data. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such
expansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).
There was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please
bear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say
what others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.

>Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The
>telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule
>today.

As I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or
similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions
such as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how
this thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat
this in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other
areas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if
this proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in
several other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not
going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop
whenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather
flimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the
material, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on
periodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice
system the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty
(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not
protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would
result in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions
on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it
does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially
fishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the
right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton
and Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,
figuring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come
those consulted could be roughly described as "us insiders"?  They cannot
quietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its
exclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.
Don't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,
past or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest
and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'
or 'difficult'.

>But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the

So what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved
after the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,
easily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,
would authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This
has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For
local cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds
have a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe
for example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen
in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or
via a 'master key'?  I sure don't.

This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use
old-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping
was rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law
Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes
that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I
just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much
about civil and individual rights, that "puts people first".  The question
is "put people first" to WHERE?

With the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T
exist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword
scan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific
court order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.
Bet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that
they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to
keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After
awhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks
they deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would
reduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember
Nixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?

And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!
I see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice
:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to
a competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded
to be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get
one the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important
concern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...

What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You
can BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.
It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the
argumet "well, if you got nothing to hide..."  Fine. Then using that
argument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in
every room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but
the principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a
govt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as
to 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are
pretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.

Don't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish
bad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.

People would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,
because we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some
'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother
those who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.

If the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public
so many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few
isolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a
certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected
experts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was
advocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the
experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper
Chip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled
version (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the
version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who
chooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...
:-)

And isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT
have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?
I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything
you have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this
group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...

Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not
be used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure
but "good enough" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full
description (not a PR non-statement) of just what "good enough" means?
I think when saying how strong it is, "good enough" really means "not
very".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not
acceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and
Constitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other
countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as
revokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and
protections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA
have this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of
Rights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining
for yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair
the damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but "too
many rights and safeguards" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court
system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having
"too many rights" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,
etc).

BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe
this:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights
under the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades
have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the
Constitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it
isn't too late allready.

As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the
infrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that
is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of
attitude on the part of the government.

Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to
ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it
difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the
fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the
government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John
Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.

Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the
FBI gets their pet "wiretap without leaving the office" scheme. There
is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours,
everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being
monitored more closely than ever before possible.

Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools
like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be
successfully imposed.

Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can
trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust
EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not
willing to make that leap of faith.

I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens
to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I
could be killed for my beliefs. Call Amnesty International some time
to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.

All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece
of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and
more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in
countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years.
Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted
for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by
dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never
ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and
the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?

If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we
make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because
if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually
stick. 

Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where
hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led
by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to
dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled
men before they became a tyranny.

I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here.
Only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has
happened elsewhere.

   I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein asked--how does the
Clipper chip exchange keys?  If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long,
does anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that key
size?  (Diffie-Hellman or maybe El Gamal, with p set to a constant value?)
   Presumably, the real scheme is something like:
 
   1.  Exchange/verify public keys.
   2.  Send encrypted (randomly-generated) session key.
   3.  Encrypt / Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher.
 
   Can anyone elaborate on this, or show me what I'm missing here?

Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White
House Clipper chip crypto initiative.  I think this is going to be a
tough measure to fight, since the Government has invested a lot of
resources in developing this high-profile initiative.  They are
serious about it now.  It won't be as easy as it was defeating Senate
Bill 266 in 1991.

Possible actions to take in response:

1)  Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list, and
more.

2)  Work the Press.  Talk with your local newspaper's science and
technology reporter.  Write to your favorite trade rags.  Better yet,
write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or
newspapers.  Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea. 
Remember to tailor it to your audience.  The general public may be
slow to grasp why it's a bad idea, since it seems so technical and
arcane and innocent sounding.  Try not to come across as a flaming
libertarian paranoid extremist, even if you are one. 

3)  Lobby Congress.  Write letters and make phone calls to your
Member of Congress in your own district, as well as your two US
Senators.  Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of
technology issues.  Talk to those aides.

4)  Involve your local political parties.  The Libertarian party
would certainly be interested.  There are also libertarian wings of
the Democrat and Republican parties.  The right to privacy has a
surprisingly broad appeal, spanning all parts of the political
spectrum.  We have many natural allies.  The ACLU.  The NRA.  Other
activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government
that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play
themselves out.  But you must articulate our arguments well if you
want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues.

4)  Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), assuming
these groups will fight this initiative.  They need money for legal
expenses and lobbying.

5)  Mobilize opposition in industry.  Companies that will presumably
develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be
lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a
telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your
coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then
present your company's management with a united front of engineering
talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your
management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold
meetings on it.

6)  Publicize, deploy and entrench as much guerrilla
techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can.  That means PGP,
anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP, PGP key servers,
etc.  The widespread availability of this kind of technology might
also be used as an argument that it can't be effectively suppressed
by Government action.  I will also be working to develop new useful
tools for these purposes. 

7)  Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on
this topic.  We don't know yet how tough this fight will be, so we
may have to compromise to get most of what we want.  If we can't
outright defeat it, we may have to live with a modified version of
this Clipper chip plan in the end.  So we'd better be prepared to
analyze the Government's plan, and articulate how we want it
modified.


-Philip Zimmermann





The cryptographic algorythm MUST be kept secret, or
private individuals could make ClipperClones with
which they could transmit messages which the feds would not have
ready access to.  This is clearly unacceptable.

I hope somebody starts doing this soon after the first
ones are released...

   I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders.
It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology,
and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, the
proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what
exists now.
 
   The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to
concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA
has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,
probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the
existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of
possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)
a DES keysearch machine.
 
   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination
could acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, since
it would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crooked
jodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agency
or organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are used
to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-
nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who would
trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for
(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all the
complaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollars
to build a keysearch machine for.)
 
   How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of
the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How about
home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers?
"Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.
Maybe I can help..."
 
>>I'd trust something from the NSA long before I'd trust something from some
>>Swiss or anybody Japanese.
 
   Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likely
as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistant
to "practical cryptanalysis."  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes how
several NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despite
security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.  And
NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of
police organizations and courts across the land.

  The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers would

isn't in the least difficult to understand, and plays on a concern lots of
people are worried about already....

It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed
is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec
functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.

You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have
a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the
middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on
a byte stream.

With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. 
Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.

At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible
modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on
the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get
the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty
home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought
for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software
(which I don't).

The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -
the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.
Economics, I'm afraid.

However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with
the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)

"Secure"? How do you know? Because NSA is trying to make you believe it?
"Trust us." Yeah, right.

"Otherwise you are on your own"? How do you know that tomorrow they

I am sure that -you- would be happy to use anything "they" tell you is
secure; we're talking about the intelligent people here... Or the
criminal ones, if you don't like the previous sentence... :-) Or those
who don't want their privacy to be guaranteed to be invadable by the

Even if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment,
and even if you are happy with such system and the current escrow
agencies NOW, what guarantees that you'll be happy with them TOMORROW,
when the government changes? Or when the current government throws
away the sheep skin? All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get
caught by surprise, but it will be too late, because then cryptography
that is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already
have been outlawed... After all, you've already got privacy that is
said to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies, so if you
are law-abiding, you have no reasons to use a stronger one, right? So,
if you are using a stronger one, you have something to hide from the
law enforcement agencies, right? Something unlawful, right? Therefore,
strong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something
unlawful.

> I'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap

Considering the level of competence in cryptology that you have
demonstrated in your messages, you would trust just anything... And
no, this is not an ad hominem attack; it's an attack against the
contents of your messages <grin>.

> doors--I'd be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined

And how do you know that these experts are not corrupted? And how do
you know that they will not make a mistake? And how do you know that
the version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same
as the one that will be really used?

Regarding the mistake - even the few information "they" have let out
has revealed a serious security hole in the protocol - the 80-bit key
is split in two 40-bit ones, thus the whole system is easily
breakable, if you have only one of the keys.

The Swiss or the Japanese are motivated by simple greed; NSA is
motivated by their wish to control the people. That's why the drug
dealers have their accounts in Swiss banks, instead of in American
ones. For some reason, they do trust the Swiss banks more... Guess
they'll trust the Swiss encryption more too... I see IDEA becoming
suddenly popular... :-)

It's not surprising at all, but not because of the reason you give.
It's because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of
money behind this program and it will support it. Thus, most
corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it
too. The same good old greed. Strong encryption is not widely
available now not because of some plot, but because the companies
don't see much money in it. It will be available even less, if the
companies can see any penalties associated with it...

> Just some perspective from another point of view.

Yeah, just as I predicted, you are here again, to support the new
system.

Instead of reading between the lines, try to think a little bit. OK,
if that's way too difficult to you, here are some hints.

Indeed, the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police, if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone. So, guess what they will
do? Propose that the new technology is removed? Or implement some
"facilitations"? Of course, you won't want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters, because meanwhile those two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child, right? So,
there should be some way for them to get access to those keys
-quickly-, right? Like, they could have a copy of the database, and
worry about a warrant later...

I've been asked to supply more specific directions
for automated fetching of the source and documentation
for "agrep," the powerful similarity pattern matching tool.

It is at

cs.arizona.edu
192.12.69.5

in directory

/agrep/README
/agrep/agrep-2.04.tar.Z
/agrep/agrep.ps.1.Z
/agrep/agrep.ps.2.Z

(The .ps suffixed files are the optional postscript docs; 
a reasonably good research report with benchmarks is
included.)

Note for Macintosh MPW users: after a few hours of drudgery,
I ported the tool to MPW 3.2.3 running under System 7.1.
If you would like me to e-mail a binhexed copy of the tool
suitable for dropping in to your MPW/tools folder, please write...

Other than the more purely cryptographic uses for the tool
I've been having lots of fun picking up the "lost"
references to things I'm interested in. For example,
starting a search like:

agrep -1 -i 'Burning Chrome' cyberpunkspool 

immediately finds references like 'burning crome' that I
have always missed before.  See how many times John
Gilmore's name is mentioned in the CUD archives
(and how often misspelled).  How about _your_ name?

As usual, I will e-mail the uuencoded tar.Z upon request
if you cannot do anonymous FTP.

I have also been in contact with Mitch about this. I believe
him when he says he didn't ask to be on the "clipper" list.

He also forwarded the traffic he had recieved through that list to
me which will be placed at some ftp site.

However, the first alias on the "clipper list" was csspab which was

these people had their accounts within the dockmaster domain.

It's OK, it's OK... Just a month ago I expressed my belief that the

( Below is my response to Dr. Denning's letter to Steven Bellovin. Comments
  are invited. - Paul )

In alt.privacy.clipper, Steve Bellovin posted your message to
him, which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies
as escrow agencies.

I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow
agencies won't be law enforcement agencies. I would argue, however,
that *one* of the escrow agencies shouldn't be federal at all.

As a private citizen, I would feel much more "secure in my person and
papers" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil
liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of
my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure
by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or
overtly controlled by the government.

Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you
mentioned, I have the following comments:

	- SRI, Rand, Mitre, and national labs: I agree that they have
        great experience safeguarding sensitive information. I am not
        convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_
	information, since in any case requiring disclosure, there's
      	likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly
 	*wrongful* disclosure.

	- GAO: perhaps. I would like to see more concrete evidence of
 	their fidelity and ability.

	- *TREASURY*? Surely you're joking. Perhaps you'd ask BATF
	to safeguard keys. Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a 
	better choice.

Ever since last fall's "trial balloon" was posted in sci.crypt, your
name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in
the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law.

I agree with you in part: those agencies and agents *almost always*
act properly. However, there have been enough cases where _sworn
agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel
that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable.

	Are you sure you aren't being watched?  Let me remind you that 
Watergate was only the tip of the iceberg.  Nixon extensively used the NSA
to watch people because he didn't like them.  According to _Decrypting the
Puzzle Palace_:

	Presumably, the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance
	by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978(FISA) and a
	series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by
	President Ford following Richard Nixon's bold misuse of the NSA, in
	which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic
	surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.

	Of course, just because there are laws saying the gov't is not 
supposed to conduct illegal surveillance doesn't mean those laws can't be
broken when they are in the way.

Read the Constitution yourself.  The Second Amendment says the right to bear
arms shall not be infringed, so a well regulated militia may be more easily
formed.  I have an interpretation of the Second that shows there are no 
qualifications to the right to keep and bear arms.  If you want, I can E-mail

The final stages of denial... I can hardly imagine what the result
would have been if the Clinton administration had actually supported
this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
obviously doing.  I don't believe the chip originated with the Clinton
administration either, but the Clinton administration has embraced it
and brought it to fruition.

Both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem
to feel that they're doing you a favor.  If this is really surprising
to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
previous evidence.  There's only one political party (not calling
anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals
worthy in and of themselves.  If you're voting for the big two, you're
supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their
histories), regardless of whether you personally support that
reduction.  To paint Clinton and Gore as unwitting tools is really
stretching things.

I am sure you didn't miss the implication that we could have another
Richard Nixon type president in the future (perhaps not too distant
future, acutally).  With that in mind, then I take it you also would
not object to the Gov coming up with a decision (not proposal - just
like Clinton Cripple is a decision, not a proposal) sprung on us to
start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house,
which could be activated without your knowlege.  They would be well
concealed so you wouldn't know the location, to prevent you from covering
the lens opening.  After all, nothing you're doing would be of the
slightest interest to a government official, right?  So, you surely
should not object to such a proposal...

Not the best anology, but the principle is pretty close - the ability
to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort, without your
knowlege, protected by entirely by "government safeguards".  You can
still draw your curtains, so you can still have your privacy from everyone
else (except Big Brother)!!  After all we need this for protection from
drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals (like 'enemies of the
STATE')... and you don't really have a right to "unbreakable" privacy
anyway, sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION
puts it...

I find it curious they use the word "unbreakable" when the term really
should be "difficult to break without proper authorization" (which the
Government most certainly has at their disposal, right?  They wouldn't
want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY, would they?)...  Nawww, not
"for the People" Clinton....

Can you, while my mind is on it, give us one good reason that the
algorithm should be a secret algorithm, unless this encryption scheme
either is a joke, or contains features like a 'master key' or other back
door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping? If it was really even moderately
secure, and the government really meant to require the proper court
order and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher
the traffic, what is the need to keep the algorithm secret?  Seems I
hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm
to remain a secret to be effective, it is not a worthwhile scheme... is
this just idle talk, or is the Administration bullshitting everyone?

With GREAT skepticism, and many doubts on our Administrations intentions...

And WAIT!! We haven't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in
mind for e-mail and datafile security.  The press release does say that
this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged
citizens.  Perhaps 'subjects' would be the better term - 'citizens'
somehow does not seem appropriate... that implies a free people, 'subjects'
better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers.
One thing for certain:  The government no longer regards the citizens
as their bosses anymore, but the other way around...

Even if what Brad says turns out to be accurate, you can bet that the
Administration will have made it "very clear" to the vendors that "it
would very much be in their best interests" to institute a "voluntary"
policy of refusing to sell anything but Clinton Cripple equipped equipment
to anyone other than "Authorized government agencies and Law Enforcement",
or individuals and corporations who "have been been determined by the
Administration to have a valid need on a case-by-case basis" for an
effective system.

Note that this is very much like the language used in many gun control
bills/laws the Administration is pushing for, or otherwise supporting.
The logic and actual rationale (as opposed to the excuses that get fed
to the media) is the same in both cases, only the items or technology
in question are different.

I think this is no accident.  It comes from the same philosophy that
the government rules/controls the people, not the people controlling
the government, that the unconnected citizens are not sophisticated enough
to know what is best for them, so the government must tell the people
what they need or do not need ... "we know best...".  And the idea that
that a commoner can defend himself against government eavesdropping
or unlawful attack is totally unacceptable to people with this outlook.

>
>Hal Finney

Combine this all with pushing for national identity cards with 'smart
chips' to encode anything they please (internal passport) under the
guise of streamlining the State People's Health Care System, and with
(you can be certain) more jewels yet to come, and one sees an extremely
ominous trend.  So what if "1984" will be ten years late... it still is
turning out to be an amazingly accurate prophecy... unless a LOT of
people wake up, and in a hurry.

One should ALWAYS have every red warning light and bell and danger flag
come up when the government seeks to set itself apart in regard to
rights, etc.  from the unconnected/unprivileged citizen (or should we
now be saying 'subject' instead?)...  Why SHOULDN'T the average person
have a good, secure system of data security, not dependent on nebulous
'safeguards' for maintaining that security?  Why SHOULDN'T the average
person be able to defend himself from an agency gone rogue?  0I am sure
the Feds could break into any data they really wanted to (but it would
take some WORK), and using the same logic, one should not be allowed to
have a good safe, unless a duplicate of the key(s) or combination are
submitted for 'safekeeping' by the government?  I don't really see a
difference, philosophically.  Encrypted data sure won't evaporate, not
with such high-tech tools as a TAPE RECORDER...

Here is a disturbing thought.

Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in
the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database
get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were
I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow
houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)

Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of
serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but
this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the
population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for
each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who
cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my
pocket on two 8mm tapes.

Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole
database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks
in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day
by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience
will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At
some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte
tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will
doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that "can't" is a
prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.

With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for
every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you
need the "master key" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information
that have to be stored an awful lot of places.

Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database
isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial
political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the
ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the
evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have
a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial
secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why
our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left
unexplained by those that point out this threat.) 

Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA
and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened
many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some
fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.

Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on
the escrow databases.

We crypto types are all taught something very important at the
beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the
easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a
secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our
teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they
would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million
Clipper chips.

I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this
doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too
many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect
that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are
doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue
to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect
that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can
try to delay things as long as possible.

Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable
bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe
that this scheme might give people some security, even as their
subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of
it all.

The Supreme Court seems to disagree with you -- they have stated that
"the people" is a term of art refering to an individual right, and
have explicitly mentioned the second amendment as an example.

I quote:

  "... 'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in
  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the
  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the
  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people
  to keep and bear Arms ...."
	- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).

Furthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution
for possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not
presented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the
government that such weapons have no military value -- they held that
the amendment protected the individual right to possess military
weapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully
gotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the
interpretation.

Furthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:

 "The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,
  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the
  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major
  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-
  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right
  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner."
   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the
     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,
     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )

You might rightfully ask "well then, what does that first bit about
militias mean?"

Well, "militia" in historical context basically means the whole of the
adult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines
"militia" as all armed men over the age of 17).

   "The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting
    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were
    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of
    the kind in common use at the time."
	- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).

The reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale
behind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to
bear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military
power could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the
government would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than
the other way around.

   "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason
   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last
   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government."
     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776
       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).

   "And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of
   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be
   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in
       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).

   "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;
   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme
   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;
   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute
   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on
   any pretense, raised in the United States."
     - Noah Webster, "An Examination into the Leading Principles
       of the Federal Constitution" (1787), in Pamphlets on the
       Constitution of the United States (P. Ford, 1888).

You may disagree with the second amendment, and wish that it be
repealed, but please do not pretend that it isn't there and that it
doesn't mean what it says. You might argue that conditions have
changed and that it should no longer be present, but you can't imagine
it away.

I could fill a book with detailed argumentation. Many have already.

However, none of this has anything to do with cryptography.  Lets get
it out of here. If you insist on discussing this, please do it in
talk.politics.guns, where people will gladly discuss this matter with
you.

denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu (Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Quisling) writes:

   Each chip includes the following components:

      the Skipjack encryption algorithm
      F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
      N, a 30-bit serial number
      U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

Hmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is
derived deterministically from this serial number. That means that
there are only one billion possible unit keys.

   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
   64-bit block R1:

	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies.

Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial
number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2
is an intentional way of assuring a "fail safe" for the government --
U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not
change they constitute effective "master keys" (along with F), the
theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)
completely obviates the security of the system. However, more
interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no
matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1
and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space
if it NOT to provide an additional back door?

I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on
approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on
the back of a napkin.

Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this
restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is
assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the
goal is an illusion of security.

If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if
they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number
pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one
understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,
soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via
espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well
-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but
by the time we know it may be too late.

   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.
   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the
   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional
   assurance that no information is left behind.

None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of
"destroying the laptop" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.
We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned
off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know
is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the
first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the
agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their
information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make
the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing
this in a "vault" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room
with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make
high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little
for most of the rest of us.

   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
   the escrow agencies.

What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and
the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always
honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they
have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to
steal they keys as they effectively already have them.

Oh, but can Big Brother afford such things in these times of tight
budgets?

I don't know how many folks noticed it, but Dorothy "Trust Me" Denning gave
a real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when
she said the NSA told her they didn't even want to be the holder of any
part of the key.  

Now why is that?  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack.  (But we will
never know).  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they
couldn't compromise.  Ergo, NSA is now capable of compromising (probably
with brute force keysearch) engines of the complexity of Skipjack.  Look
at the specs.  Why, I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging
away in their crypto busters... Maybe even tens of thousands.  Complexity?
Not much more than a 3090.  How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade?

I think PGP2.3 should have 256 bit IDEA keys...

If you've got a secure device, you don't need public keys.

If the secret key which all chips share is SK, you can just use KP =

Maybe that's why Jim Bidzos was reported as being cheesed off.

Secrecy in Clipper Chip

The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and
transmitted as one part of a three part message.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis).

Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel.  The purpose of this chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the system key

	2) Recieve Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number
	    is necessary for local operation).

This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  This gets more
interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,
making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and
a spoofed serial number.  Without knowing the system key, you could
lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.

IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could
successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the
format of your own serial number.

Makes you wonder whats being hidden here?   Seems  like the secrecy is
to prevent you from lying about who you are.

I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?

Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy 
a bunch of their stuff :).

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
look at it :).

Great!  Where can I buy it?

Another note: If "Clipper" increases the incentive to bring stronger 
encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at 
the moment.

You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a 
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making 
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.

Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone 
*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute 
for the "voice scramblers" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.

Well, I'm not a lawyer, but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue.

You see, this country has this thing called a "constitution".

If you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are
not a government employee or otherwise encumbered, I don't think they
can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
determine. Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent? The First Amendment
applies here.

The U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information. However, if they
sell you the chip, I can't see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal.

	From: Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>

	The majority of the discussion involving this "Clipper Chip" seems to
	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone
	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
	signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.

I'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  I suspect
to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  There would
be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which I suspect would scupper
any of the suggestions I've seen here about putting a different encryption
front end on it.

There's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  I'm sure it's purely
a digital chip.  The back end will come later, but I'm *positive* it won't
be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation
scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them.

The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones.
(Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )

I've got no doubts that this would probably have gone ahead if Bush

Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?



One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration
body is the ACLU.  I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is
essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people's civil
liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get
involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good
reason.

When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the
auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a
security point of view, but wouldn't tell us how to fix it.  I always
figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix
the problem.

Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.
Auditors don't like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a
bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The
auditee can say, "Well, you told us this way would be OK."  It
compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's
job.

Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.
Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU's part, a key half gets
away that shouldn't, and is used to deprive someone of her civil
liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.
But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant
and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.

There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one
place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed
automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum
was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and
was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.

I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration
situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll
checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again
today, he better be able to produce yesterday's checks so that they can
be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are
legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could
put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU
conflict of interest.

As always, my opinions are my own.

	I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines
are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart
hardware?)

	The 'plaintext' is digitized voice, and exists for a very short
time, probably in a couple inches of copper, tops. It's flatly not
available -- your bug in my office can hear my voice, and even digitize
it, but it's going to get a different bitstream.

	It is horribly naive to suppose that regular folks can figure
out how to crack skipjack, or clipper based telephones. I'm certainly
not devoting a great deal of thought to it.

I find this a very disturbing view!  Yes, we DO care about EVERYONE's
privacy... Even if "they" don't know it. What happens if the gov't
starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such
technologies become the only "legal" encryption forms?  What happens
when the Clipper is the *ONLY* type of encryption chips available to
the masses?

Sure, you might have your own method of encryption, but if you don't
have anyone else to talk to, what use is it?  You can't assume that
EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption.

The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip.
Rather, it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key, safe-deposit box keys, etc., and telling you
that "they wont use them unless its totally neccessary."  I sure
wouldn't want that.  Why should encryption be any different?

I'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted (that's what happens
when you read news at home when you're rat-arsed), but I did have a bunch
of follow-ups going on about cellular/cordless comms.  The original article
has reappeared, so:

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
    enforcement.

Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on
ordinary landlines.

    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications
links.

OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will
be applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop
people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't
even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's
misfortunes).

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear
when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary
conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable
as at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio
links.

OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone
lines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.

My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it
clear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of
obfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise
(IMHO).


BTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen any
replies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?  Have I made it into
everyone's kill file, or is there some problem?

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, 
from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for 
strong cryptography through a distinct organization.

The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the
contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin
already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one
step removed from the old "crypto-wielding child molester" argument.  An
EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the
connection to child pornography and the like.

Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In
light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it
stands to be labelled as "communist", "anarchist hackers", radical, etc.  

I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social
Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical
antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political
baggage.

Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography
would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing
group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to
advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's
question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going
to do about it?

Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,
I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:
gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

Normally I'd be the last to argue with Steve . . . but shouldn't that
read "3.8 years for *all* solutions".  I mean, if we can imagine the
machine that does 1 trial/nanosecond, we can imagine the storage medium
that could index and archive it.

I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post, but that's
what I get from posting at 1 am...

The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to
play by the rules and get warrants, legit escrowed keys, etc., may find
themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting
at the federal level.  

I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy
cops.  It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more
police agencies to "go rogue" and try to get keys through more efficient
(but less Constitutional) means.  Notice what the release said:

   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
        decipher the message?

   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.
        ^^^^^^^^^^^

The clear implication is that there are "legal" authorizations other
than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who 
knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There
may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which
keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent
position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They
already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There
are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access
police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be
very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such
evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.

Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional
restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've "retired" from intelligence
agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.

Don't think it'll happen?  

Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional
organization, which for years kept "Red Files" on thousands of suspected 
commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards
of evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they
happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship
rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license
plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the 
meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.
(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any
more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes
as well.)

Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will 
be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need
to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest 
of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  
Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) 
will be a moral dilemma.

Clipper will make criminals out of cops.  Do we want to do this to our
police forces?

Once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to 
phsyical inspection and observation.  Now, I will grant that there will no 
doubt be safeguards against "peeling" the chip, but the NSA has no monopoly 
on cleverness.  The chip, and the algorithms it uses, will not remain secret 
for very long.  Any university with a VLSI lab has the required equipment, as 
does any offshore semiconductor manufacturer.

I don't claim to be a crypto analyist... there isn't a whole lot of good
literature on the subject, and the best people don't seem to publish
their work :)  but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute
force (sorry to have implied that in my previous post).  The history
of these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and
bang from there.

I guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA would
make publicly available a system they couldn't break if they wanted...
it just isn't in their charter.  Remember DES came from IBM, not NSA
and, when first published, was given a useful life of 20 years... I think
we are well past that point now :(

Remember, based on the size of the NSA budget, they spend a lot more
on the technology of decryption than most computer companies spend on
R&D.  I have to imagine their stuff is real interesting...

A friend who once worked for them (he is dead now) said he always enjoyed
monitoring SAC's (Strategic Air Command) crypto traffic :)  and I rather
suspect that stuff is a bit more complex than Skipjack  (Or was it the
military got the stuff from the NSA just like we get Skipjack from them ;)
[BTW, folks, NSA wasn't being given the keys.  And the Walker spy case
shows for some of the systems, the KGB didn't need them either.]

Never forget that.  Our Founding Fathers sure were concerned about it.

   But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as
proposed.  Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys
if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY.  (One chip,
one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that
break gives you all messages involving that phone.)

   The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you
nothing is an improvement, but notice that XORing with (truely random)
bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  Using +
for XOR, SK for the escrowed key, and A and B for two random bit
strings, hand SK+A+B, SK+A, and SK+B to three escrow agents.  It is
possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern,
for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives
the cracking agency no benefit.

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at
full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want
less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable
you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This
requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could
probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply
instruction and a few other DSP things.

If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a
second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000
8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1
compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about
V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.
Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need
sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a
PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap
- you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the
SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't

Now why would anyone "post" anything encrypted? Encryption is only of 
use between persons who know how to decrypt the data.

And why should I care what other people look at? 

What does concern me is the continued erosion of my constitutional
rights. ( Amendments I, II, IV, and V to note a few. )

The problem with "Let's assume" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme
(and you're close), you arrive at "Let's assume this is perfectly OK."

The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then
why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty
of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure,
so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but
I certainly can't think of any honest ones.

Next, you assume we can "trust" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked,
EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure,
corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is
saying "Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us."  Bullcrypt. 

And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume
that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case
in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately
fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this
score.

Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others
have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure
encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand.
Who will be able to afford, and be sufficiently motivated, to purchase this
expensive, inconvenient higher protection?  Somebody with lots of extra
cash...

The following is more true than ever:

  "When [strong] encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have [strong]
encryption."

 "You can observe a lot just by watching."  -Yogi Bera



Having read the various "Clipper" announcements on the net over the last few 
days and a LOT of uninformed speculation about the chip, its uses,
government plots, etc, I have the following questions.

  1) What does the "Clipper chip" actually implement? Just the Skipjack
	cryptographic algorithm? Or does it also implement a "chip to chip"
	communications protocol? If it does implement a communications
	protocol, can it be used as just a "crypt chip" also.

  2) Where can the chip specifications and spec sheets be obtained?

  3) Who may purchase them and under what conditions?

  4) Are there restrictions as to how the chip may be used in a system?

  5) The security of the algorithm and the encrypted communications does
	not appear to require that the "Family key" be a secret. Why is
	it a secret? What happens when the "family key" becomes well known?
	If it's a secret to make traffic analysis more difficult, does
	the "Law enforcement message" contain any random information?
	How much and how random is it?

  6) Can the chip be programmed to reveal the "Unit key"? The chip "serial
	number"? Any of the programming parameters?

Just to make sure everyone is clear on this: "it never has" refers to 
"protects", not "fails to protect"; i.e., in my lifetime I have never seen 
the U.S. government consistently protect the interest of U.S. citizens, 
except by accident.

In fact, since effective encryption makes censorship impossible, they

Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors
and provides some additional information and explanation.


                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                           Revised, April 21, 1993


INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP CONTENTS

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the
"MYK-78."  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the
session key:

   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit
key parts.  

The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies. 

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.


CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the Clipper Chip, called "Capstone" by the government
and "MYK-80" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July.

Useful?  I find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement
of $5 million quite useful, if rough (e.g. wiretaps may be
preferentially used on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminals, resulting
in an underestimate).  This comes to twenty cents a head over the
U.S. population.  I would find some rigorous numbers on this quite
useful -- it would make for nice slogans: "Your privacy is worth

From Denning:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  

Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.
Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.

Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
analysis).

Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip
and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:
    
	1) Transmit Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number
	    unrecoverable with just the family key

	2) Receive Channel

	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number
	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the
	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -
	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).

This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is
a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits
as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block
can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed
Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,
The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits
of N in E[N; F].

The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the
mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the
entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme
such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block
can be recovered are lessened.

What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the
serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission
becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol
transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?

One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block
containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.

The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to 
detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law
enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state
for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.

It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within
the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,
requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting
and decrypting E(M; K);

The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including
on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could
be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?

Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without
redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial
number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should
not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for
procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,
stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice
from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with
a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and 
distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen
clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not 
sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.
This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or
spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted
stream.

Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned
scheme.

******************************************************************************

If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use
them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid
law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching
the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet
deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement
block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,
such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require
escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.

The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of
clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated
by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream
and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key
generator synchronized between endpoints.

The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited
based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission
interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's
supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to
the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants
an encryption chip with a real time clock?

*****************************************************************************

The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.

  I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the
FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.
  If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole
debate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the
field say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the
Feds.  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented
as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from
superior competition.

Hell, just set up a spark jammer, or some other _very_ electrically-noisy
device. Or build an active Farrady cage around the room, with a "noise"
signal piped into it. While these measures will not totally mask the
emissions of your equipment, they will provide sufficient interference to
make remote monitoring a chancy proposition, at best. There is, of course,
the consideration that these measures may (and almost cretainly will)
cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems. It's a matter
of balancing security versus convenience.

Telecommunications/Cryptographic Equipment Technician.

The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack  
against DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB  
mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. Questions:

 - Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? Then we have  
a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key.
 
 - If yes: Is anything known about the security of this key scheme? Can we  
break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space?

In this giant bally-ho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the E-mail and posts I've tossing back and
forth.  

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.

The reason is very simple:  How many people do you want to die in a riot? 
In a new Civil War? 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it, and I'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper.  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it?  Examine your
history books, and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
(or Democratic style) governments.  I think you'll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history.

That's not very good odds.  

Somebody once said something like: "Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in
agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder."

Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the
world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.

I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.  I don't
want my children growing up in a War Zone.

	  The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as

	doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry

S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all
compromised.  If they're not compromisable, why the hell not use a
hardware true random number source.  There isn't a random number
source *anywhere* in this proposal.  The whole thing is deterministic
from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip.

Nope, it can't be trusted.  This is all about two levels of access -
the (possibly honest) key escrow that police forces have to use, and
ostensibly the FBI; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything*
on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a

Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS:
958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;
1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.
For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.

Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was
unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this
soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods
were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".

Thus, a deciBell (deci-, l., tenth of + Bell) is a fractional part of the 
original Bell.  For example, SouthWestern Bell is a deciBell.

And the measure of current, Amp, is actually named after both the AMP company
and the Amphenol company.  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
were affected by the amount of current running through the wires.

The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers, thus

The STANDARD AT bus (ISA) runs at 8MHz, not 12.5 MHz, but some 
non-stnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  For instance, my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.

The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus 
operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.

NOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BI-DIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION.

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original 286s proves that.  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them R/W select line of the circuit to Vcc.  To make it bi ( which 
I did ) I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
the proper location.  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
Zenith ( they were not Zenith-Bull Group at that time).

The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia.  Not  
only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  
observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
cases . . ..  No foolin!  He can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  
by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (Yes,  
I realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   
His ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  
living, I have heard . . ..

So what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning  
that the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left  
is about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway???

Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have
a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
(excellent) gear).

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is
whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode.

I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are
_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.
However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)
seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a "real" scope :-)

This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated
the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has
a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time
capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at
least they appear to be logically laid out.

One more thing about the new, "simpler", front panels. These instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our
scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these
switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments.

From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are
protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube!]

{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have
them.}

Suggestion: look in the RS data book. They have several RS232
transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the
LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
ask me why. I've never used them before.

Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector. Two are listed in the
RS catalogue. If you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail
me.

RS Components (they exist in Australia and the UK. Don't know about the US) have
little chips called Isolated MAX 250 and 251. They give you isolated RS-232 from
a single 5V supply. External components are 4 caps, 4 optoisolators, a diode,
and an isloting transformer. They go up to 19.2K baud..

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least
that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface

for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired
controller.

	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE
have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice
while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity
is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately
are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more
battery power.  

	Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they
are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.
So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.

For power:

  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )

For amplitude

  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )

'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation
convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.

Common references for audio are:

	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV = 1 volt

	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)
	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)


Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.

Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

If you can find a copy of "8088 Assembler Language Programming: The IBM PC"
by Willen and Krantz, 2nd ed. pub. by Sams, there is a discussion of the
game control adapter, monostable multivibrators, and conversion to other
uses, as well as an assembler program. If you need greater accuracy, there
is no reason you couldn't modify the approach to suit your needs.

I need a off-the-shelf method of transmitting small amounts of data up to
300 feet.  The data is low speed and can be encoded as needed.  Low power
on the transmitting end would be a plus.  An FCC certified product would
be prefered.

If you have any pointers to products or companies I'd appreciate hearing from
you.

Thanks,
Ken

Hi,

   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor
voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 
260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output
voltage as possible. (about 260v).
  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v
across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.
  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.
 If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will
increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.
These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of
them, So:

1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel 
with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?
  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase
the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...
as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out.

and
2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH
of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my 
dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not
playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long
run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

Email please.... Can't always read the net.....

Thanks in advance..

 The balls are used to reduce the amplitude of oscillations of the wire during

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.

When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the
National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,
it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you
have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead
gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know
the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.

The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for
example.

The best info I have seen so far is the article "Joystick Metrics:
Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port" by
Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in
BASIC, and even includes code for a simple "oscilloscope" display.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,
etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

Brad,
   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way 
to get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The 
"gain" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred 
direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.

 So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall
Damark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do
a sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don't
seem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to
heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats
only moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.

Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:

  I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is a 
little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. Then
I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works
like a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are
relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with
my Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's
VCR, it didn't work.
  The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a
Sony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD
player...

	Any advice would be appreciated....

	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile
I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there
seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,
I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
random 50mV bias.
	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output
won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed
from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input
impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have
maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have
input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to
use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing
reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my
circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.
With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now
with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of
a pain in  the ass.
	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator
input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd
like to have this box not be active.
	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I
had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The
function generator was the same way on that one, too.

I had a GE Emerson 13" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day,
while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause),
we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound,
so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV.
The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
(we wanted a bigger one too!).
 After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but
not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?
 I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any
idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV.

The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:

"A gram of this dye costs a dollar.
It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.
And if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar."

I.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
it to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct
that cost almost nothing intrinsically.

What is happening is this:
1) You turn the TV on.
2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

Things to check:
First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

Attention hardware hackers and bargain seekers!

I just bought a 640x200 pixel LCD panel for 25 UK pounds.  I have
a datasheet for a similar panel, but I'm looking for proper data.

If anyone can help with locating data for this device (before I start
with the routine on the phone to Hitachi and rummaging through the
library), then I'll pass on the source.

	Type: LM225 (Hitachi)
	Resolution: 640W x 200H (so can do 80x25 chars on 8x8 matrix)

Bought from:

	Greenweld Electronics Ltd
	27 Park Rd
	Southampton SO1 3TB, UK

	Tel. +44 703 23 63 63
	Fax. +44 703 23 63 07
	Email: Compuserve [100014,1463]

NB: I only just bought this!  I don't even know if it works!

	Price was 25 UK pounds including VAT (17.5%), which isn't
	payable if you're outside the EC.

Thanks for any info!

Sci.E(E) netters:

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so 
cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
1000-10,000.

Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
quantity.

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This 
$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor 
chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.

P.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone else 
had better luck with this strategy?



We have a Sun CD-ROM drive which I would like to play audio CD's in.
I have an old 10 watt amplifier which works fine when connected to a
junk "Walkman" style AM/FM radio. This amp ties the common path of the
earphone connection to ground.

However, it doesn't work with my Sony Walkman cassette player, or the CD drive,
it produces of loud low-frequency tone. Obviously Sony doesn't ground
the earphone output common. Does anyone have specs on the CD drive's 
output? Will an audio transformer help? What are others using to
play there CD's in the Sun drive so that more than one can listen?

Thanks for the help.

Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound 
like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are 
common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)
which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (the
local oscillator). 

Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to
receiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must 
generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc
frequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  
The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Since
the AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...
I think you get the picture.

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you
get the idea.  Choose a high-efficiency LED so you don't need much
current to get it to light up.  Choose values for the other components
as required.

sci.electronics (and the answers aren't always apparent, even to those skilled
in electronics), I am hijacking the following FAQ and posting a copy here.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers

	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not
	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If
	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't
	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,
	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;
	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.

	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National
	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).
	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail
	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections
	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,
	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!

	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the
	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,
	however, do not.  Check your with your local building
	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in
	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,
	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements
	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that
	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family
	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial
	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different
	rules.

	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in
	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.
	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line
	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number
	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've
	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or
	``CEC''.

	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often
	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.

Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the
	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.
	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.
	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly
	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the
	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged
	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.
	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized
	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the
	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for
	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --
	US$65 plus shipping and handling.

Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up
	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance
	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.
	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two
	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,
	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.
	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified
	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA
	standard itself.  In this FAQ, "CEC" really means the
	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is
	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th
	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th
	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an
	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.

	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical
	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In
	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't
	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I
	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the
	equivalent NEC publications.

	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout
	the province.

Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?

	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.
	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical
	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's
	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do
	wiring in "commercial" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)
	are usually considered "semi-commercial" or "commercial".  However,
	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial
	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can
	find one willing to supervise.

	If you do your own wiring, an important point:

	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better
	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,
	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make
	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills
	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.
	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that
	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,
	and will impress the inspector.

	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to
	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your
	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.
	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely
	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.

	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.

	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip
	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector
	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it
	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of
	12ga wire through your hand that way.

	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C
	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types
	become very brittle.

Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?

	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few
	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're 
	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved
	devices) you need Robertson ("square recess") screwdrivers
	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.

	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4" or 1" spade bit and 1/4" or
	3/8" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or
	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2" drill
	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and
	3/4" or 1" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull
	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even
	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.

	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you
	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws
	work well).
	
	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or
	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart "combo stripper,
	crimper and bottle opener" types.  You should expect to pay
	$15 to $20 for a good "plier-type" pair.  It will have sized
	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should
	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the
	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There
	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't
	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.

	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends
	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.

	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.

	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling
	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire
	loops with a "loop former hole" on your wire stripper - more
	accurate.

	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for
	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the
	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,
	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a
	"zipper", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip
	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to
	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley
	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)
	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility
	that you'll gouge the conductors.

	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well
	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).
	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire
	or the insulation.

	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired
	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more
	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple
	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated
	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost
	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.

	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are
	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)
	and work well.  If you get more serious, a "audible alarm" type is
	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known
	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)

	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.
	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or
	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.

	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent
	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for
	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap 
	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination
	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to
	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet
	that has no cover plate).

Subject: What is UL listing?

	The UL stands for "Underwriters Laboratory".  It used to be
	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent
	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment
	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means
	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements
	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily
	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just
	that it probably won't kill you.

	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are
	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,
	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will
	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to
	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in
	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component
	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.
	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring
	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or
	occupancy permits issued.
	
Subject: What is CSA approval?

	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the
	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in
	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done
	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to
	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is
	required by law.

	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved
	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the
	claim.

	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC
	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to
	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance
	companies.

Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?

	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers

	    Residential Wiring
	    by Jeff Markell,
	    Craftsman Books,
	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.

	    Practical Electrical Wiring
	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National
	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70
	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan
	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.

	    Wiring Simplified
	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan
	    Park Publishing Co.
	
	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC
	revision.  Which is currently 1990.

	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called
	"Electrical Code Simplified".  There appears to be a version
	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the
	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,
	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get
	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer
	questions on the net ;-).

	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is
	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.

Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?

	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and
	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more
	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not
	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections
	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors
	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose
	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.

	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your
	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a
	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about
	this.

	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at
	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage
	claims.

	In general, the process goes like this:
		- you apply to your local inspections office or building
		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or
		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is
		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not
		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose
		  special conditions on you, require loading
		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point
		  they will tell you which inspections you will need.
		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to
		  have the panel and service connections inspected
		  before your power utility will provide a connection.
		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority
		  rather than the usual inspectors.
		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before
		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a
		  "rough-in" inspection.
		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,
		  you will need a "final inspection".

Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.
	Do I have to upgrade?

	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,
	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some
	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the
	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you
	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all
	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.

Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240

	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the
	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of
	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V
	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same
	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required
	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.
	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there
	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not
	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped
	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially
	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number
	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,
	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.
	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them "110V" and
	"220V", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will
	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.

	One thing that might make this a little more understandable
	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V
	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device
	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that
	low.

	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between
	phases of a 3-phase "Y" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any
	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase "Y"
	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.

	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended
	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...

Subject: What does an electrical service look like?

	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the
	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility
	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.

 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded
 	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes
 	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where
	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic
	action conductivity "breaks" (often between copper and iron pipe)).
	This is the "grounding conductor".  It is there to make sure that
	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire
	normally carries no current.

	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or
	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.
	It is connected to the "centre tap" (CEC; "center tap" in the
	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It
	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often
	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected
	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.

	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in
	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.
	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral
	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional
	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house
	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.

	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually
	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are
	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one
	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations 
	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do
	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your
	inspector.

	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the "hot"
	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as
	well.

	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each
	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,
	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the
	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.

	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.
	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected
	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one
	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some
	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only
	service).

Subject: What is a circuit?

	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.
	These connections are then used to supply power to selected
	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:
		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.
		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.
		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,
		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.

	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and
	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying
	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they
	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several
	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is
	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or
	air conditioners.

	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar
	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there
	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral
	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing
	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead
	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.
	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles
	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but
	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,
	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to
	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is
	permissible.]

	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,
	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.

	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a
	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.

	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground
	wire.  Since the white is "hot" in this case, both the NEC and CEC
	requires that the white wire be "permanently marked" at the ends
	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail
	polish or sometimes electrical tape.

	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the
	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.

	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)
	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places
	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is "frame ground",
	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an
	alternative to GFCI protection.

Subject: "grounding" versus "grounded" versus "neutral".

	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the
	"grounding" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green
	or bare wire.  The word "neutral" is reserved for the white when
	you have a circuit with more than one "hot" wire.  Since the white
	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the
	panel, the proper term is "grounded conductor".  However, the
	potential confusion between "grounded conductor" and "grounding
	conductor" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should
	never use the bare wire as a "grounded conductor" or white wire
	as the "grounding conductor", even though they are connected
	together in the panel.

	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground
	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]

	In the trade, and in common usage, the word "neutral" is used
	for "grounded conductor".  This FAQ uses "neutral" simply to
	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use "neutral"
	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light
	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.

Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?

	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power
	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For
	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should
	"trip", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As
	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the
	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the
	equipment itself won't cause a fire.

	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt
	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby
	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively
	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have
	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use
	a "time-delay" fuse (one brand is "fusetron") which will avoid
	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a
	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be
	replaced.

	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They
	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched
	into position against another contact.  When the current flow
	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip
	heats up and bends.  By bending it "trips" the latch, and the
	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave
	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to
	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high
	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite
	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown
	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which
	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in
	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the
	purpose.

	Neither fuses nor breakers "limit" the current per se.  A dead
	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even
	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which
	can often cause severe damage.

Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?

	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher
	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually
	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts
	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse
	being installed, or the proverbial "replace the fuse with a
	penny" trick.

	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better
	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.

	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When
	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting
	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,
	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical
	distribution transformer and having your house burn down.
	Breakers don't do this.

	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit
	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new
	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special
	inserts to "key" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)

	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse
	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse
	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the
	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently
	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you
	if you need one.

Subject: What size wire should I use?

	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,
	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,
	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid
	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than
	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.

	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for
	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or
	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate
	heat easily:

		Gauge		Amps
		14		15
		12		20
		10		30
		8		40
		6		65
	
	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent
	on the application and precise wire type.

Subject: Where do these numbers come from?

	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.
	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When
	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is
	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need
	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in
	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long
	runs.

	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.
	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller
	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most
	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits
	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger
	wire.

Subject: What does "14-2" mean?

	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors
	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second
	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but
	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  "14-2" means
	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.

	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes
	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In
	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.

	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.
	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.

Subject: What is a "wirenut"/"marrette"/"marr connector"?  How are they
	used?

	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used
	to connect wires together.  "Marrette" or "Marr connector"
	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.

	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them
	together, then twist the wirenut on.

	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the
	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically
	secure.

	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check
	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the
	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.

	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or
	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose ("linesman") pliers,
	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes
	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it
	goes in the wirenut properly.

	Some people wrap the "open" end of the wirenut with electrical
	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may
	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because
	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead
	of taping it, the connection should be redone.

Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?

	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures
	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the
	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the
	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other
	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of
	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any
	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking
	the circuit.

	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,
	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral
	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI
	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot
	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the
	GFCI happy.

	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.
	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed
	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be
	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices
	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be
	covered by a single GFCI outlet.

Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?

	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase
	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,
	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or
	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water
	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,
	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',
	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and
	laundry appliances.

	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there
	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or
	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you
	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to
	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.

	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may
	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI
	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI
	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in
	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your
	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?
	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does
	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?

Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?

	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a
	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run
	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,
	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs
	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that
	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary
	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most
	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no
	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring
	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.

Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?

	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the
	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with
	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI
	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE
	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one
	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch
	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),
	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a
	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;
	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on
	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such
	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.

	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use
	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use
	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.

	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one
	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't
	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first
	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet
	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But
	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.

	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little
	"ground fault protected" stickers that come with it and mark
	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which
	outlets are "downstream", simply by tripping the GFCI with the
	test button and see which outlets are dead.

Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?

	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,
	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without
	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against
	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of
	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an
	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the
	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly
	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not
	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if
	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of
	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very
	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace
	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).

	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In
	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with
	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating
	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will
	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;
	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were
	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to
	ground...

Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization

	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the
	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)
	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.
	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the
	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to
	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).

	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.

	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right
	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the
	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the
	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.
	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which
	prong the terminating screw connects to.

Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?

	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance
	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex
	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more
	than 24" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider
	than 12" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.
	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except
	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits
	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,
	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be
	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).

	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab
	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to
	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.
	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When
	"carrying through" to another outlet, the neutral must be
	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral
	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect
	from downstream outlets.

Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?

	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to
	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in
	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.

Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?

	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.
	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.
	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside
	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject
	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are
	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several
	different categories of NM cable.

	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or "AC" has a
	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is
	fairly resistant to damage.

	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic
	sheath.
	
	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable
	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer
	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25" (CEC & NEC)
	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected
	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of
	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.

	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored
	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,
	but this is technically illegal.]

	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the
	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague
	references to "exposed to mechanical damage" in both the NEC
	and CEC):

	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage
	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls
	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.
	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.
	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces
	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian
	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet
	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable
	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to "jump" to the appliance.
	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.
	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating
	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by
	      means of a 25mm/1" air space, or suitable insulation
	      material (a wad of fiberglass).
	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box
	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.
	      Holes in joists or studs are considered "supports".
	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to
	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,
	      it is permitted where "proper" support is impractical]
	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.
	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring
	      to the "workmanship" clause, but this seems more honoured
	      in the breach...]
	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or
	      similar finish.
	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.
	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists
	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more
	      than 1m (39").

	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small
	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to
	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through
	the insulation.

	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by
	solid wall coverings.

	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of
	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a
	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of
	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the
	wire.

	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.

	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will
	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like
	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of
	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground
	wiring section.]

 	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be
 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that
 	purpose.

	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through
	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed
	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this
	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses
	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.
	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.
	
 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,
 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the
 	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: "AC90" versus "AC".
	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.

	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes
	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.
	There are very different requirements for mobile homes.
	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything
	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?

	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable
	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box
	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic
	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.

	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable
	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still
	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also
	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.

	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for
	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground
	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other
	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For
	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.

Subject: Junction box positioning?

	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.

	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible
	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction
	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may
	get nasty.

Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?

	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few
	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage
	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half
	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire
	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle
	constraints as well.  For example, older house
	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess
	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the
	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.
	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high
	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your
	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case
	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)

	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some
	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and
	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy
	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box
	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling
	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available
	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and
	mounted between the joists.

	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as
	"pot" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated
	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.
	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated
	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a "coffin" (usually
	8'x16"x12" - made by making a pair of joists 12" high, and covering
	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*
	long)

	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"
	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.
	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,
	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.
	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't
	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector
	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get
	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown
	in later.]

	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and
	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are
	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat
	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should
	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.
	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location
	for the sensor can vary.

	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved
	for use in insulation.  The "coffin" appears the only legal approach.

Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?

	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is
	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up
	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with
	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can
	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in
	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions
	require the stove frame connected to neutral).

	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately
	and have them come and check out the problem.

	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with
	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A
	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness
	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.

Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?

	Three phase power has three "hot" wires, 120 degrees out of
	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors
	because it is more "efficient", provides a bit more starting torque,
	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.

	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows
	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between
	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal
	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the
	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.

	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually
	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you
	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to
	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is
	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have
	a "capacitor start" unit, or use a larger motor as a
	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if
	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to
	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an
	article on how to do this if you must.

	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using
	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.

Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?

	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there
	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply
	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times
	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also
	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor
	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the
	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.

	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more
	than 50 feet long.

Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?

	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746
	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,
	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200
	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,
	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational
	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.

	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router
	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far
	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a "stall
	horsepower" or similar.  That means the power is measured when
	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.
	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that
	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker
	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far
	more current than it can continuously.

	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This
	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,
	check the amperage rating, which is always present.

Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?

	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead
	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety
	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither
	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.

	There are several different approaches to solving this:
	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the
	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect
	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle
	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.
	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and
	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can
	       run a conductor to it from the third prong.
	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.
	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug
	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI
	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI
	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong
	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,
	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it
	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault
	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected
	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't
	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath
	       on BX cable.

	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three
	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.
	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.

Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?
	Should the test button work?

	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,
	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's
	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE
	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current
	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.
	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require
	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press
	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:
	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially
	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.

	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground
	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The
	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the
	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never
	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,
	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device
	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded
	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are
	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician
	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require
	it, and promised to investigate.)

Subject: How should I wire my shop?

	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all
	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies
	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the
	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for
	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or
	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have
	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp
	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles
	which means you'd have to "replug" all your equipment.  Lights
	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared
	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two
	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a
	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand
	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.

	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the
	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.
	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each
	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same
	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and
	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have
	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit
	wrong.

	Note that some jurisdictions have a "no horizontal wiring"
	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used
	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be
	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.

	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V
	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.
	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you
	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled
	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of
	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much
	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)

	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,
	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop
	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to
	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.
	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''
	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.
	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to
	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy
	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.

	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished
	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And
	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop
	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might
	have a different idea.

	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop
	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.

Subject: Underground Wiring

	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use
	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic
	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots
	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion
	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is
	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically
	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,
	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion
	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And
	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.

	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to
	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about
	your specific situation.

	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says "buried power
	line" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.

Subject: Aluminum wiring

	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became
	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,
	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,
	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.
	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new
	wiring.

	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum
	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.
	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper
	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential
	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.

	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as
	"cold creep".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When
	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes
	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each
	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes
	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance
	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/
	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,
	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even
	cause a fire.

	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move
	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of
	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing
	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you
	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring
	for the following things:

	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to
	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will
	       be stamped with "Al/Cu" or "CO/ALR".  The latter supersedes
	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat
	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.

	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around
	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be
	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the
	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug
	       up each connection.

	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the
	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.

	    3) "push-in" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.
	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with
	       the proper screw connections immediately.

	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,
	       melted insulation, or "baked" fixtures.  Any such damage should
	       be repaired.
	    
	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be
	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the
	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting
	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be
	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an
	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter
	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless
	       you can rent the tool.

	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring
	       by means of a short copper "pigtail".  See (5) above.
	    
	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped
	       (not nicked) wire etc.
    
	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring
	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider
	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,
	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,
	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having
	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.
	You can do this yourself too.

Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?

	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire
	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.
	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an
	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor
	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any
	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many
	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.

	Here's some hints on what to look for:

	Obvious non-code wiring can include:

		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls
		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without
		  proper marking.
		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of
		  a GFCI)
		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)
		- Switched neutrals
		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines

	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one
	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:

		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps
		   not properly terminated wiring)
		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are
		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when
		  it's *really* convenient ;-)
		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations
		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps
		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them
		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or
		  ceiling
		- Backwrapped grounding wires

Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring
	
	In the years since Edison "invented" electricity, several different
	wiring "styles" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you
	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old 
	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.

	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called
	"knob and tube" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with
	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural
	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).
	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections
	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping
	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,
	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs
	down the centre of each room, with "taps" off to each fixture.
	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some
	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same
	colour as the hot wires.

	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.

	Comments on K&T:

		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about
		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.
		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up
		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in
		  quite good condition.
		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.
		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with
		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,
		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.
		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between
		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to
		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on
		  any circuit.
		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls
		  that contain K&T.
		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be
		  tricky.  Consult your inspector.
		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more
		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.
	
	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't
	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should
	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and
	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly
	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on
	new circuits using modern techniques.
	
	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type
	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks
	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was
	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.
	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback
	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole
	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at
	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.

	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if
	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as
	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.
	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several
	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink
	tubing.

	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.
	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.
	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard
	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be
	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the "modern" stuff -
	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.

Subject: Where do I buy stuff?

	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their
	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or
	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety
	including the "odd" stuff, and have people behind the counter that
	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable
	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.

I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a
chance to read the news for a couple of days...

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private
Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye.

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA
compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up
and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background.

I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly
used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.

Does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the
edges of my computer screen?  The growth has been gradual so I don't
know how long it's taken to get this bad.  I have a 19" DEC (?)
color monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1
inches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom and
negligible at the top of the screen.  The only controls are
brightness knob, contrast knob, deGauss switch, and power switch.

Is there anything to be done, or are the monitor's days numbered?

Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.
The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were
VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest
problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.

In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets
with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you
can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they
were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory
periodically.

With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be
less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer
recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their
equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find
that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it
should be o.k. for most applications.

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.
If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per
channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish.

Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced.

A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.
Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location.

  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the
10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.

  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially
double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.
The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used
previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham
Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.

  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used
at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design
of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).

  While using this would have let me reduce the "external" IF count on
receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I
didn't bother with it.

  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2
MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios
actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and
speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data
stream is another matter entirely.

  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a
"beacon" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow
due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO
also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even
though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes
of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of
a second.

  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in
and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland
IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the
proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running
low on resources of time, money and energy.

  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW
ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma
Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally
polarized.

  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly
approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and
you might want to carefully consider your "target".  If you can't
arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think
you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by
multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.
For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread
spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.
I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Where
exactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?
ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along
with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name
a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices.  

A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design
Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered
to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I
don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isn't going to make that much difference

If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...
TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.

P.S. My opinions have nothing to do with my company...the

I've recently picked up some TIL311 display chips, but I can't find
any information on them.  It seems they are no longer made by TI, and
I don't have an old enough data book.  :-(

It appears to have a dot-matrix led display capable of showing one hex

present.

If you have any information on this part (pinout, power requirments,
functions, ...) please send me e-mail.

Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always
see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many
fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination.

	This is a followup post to something I've written previously.  Several
people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated 
exactly what I am looking for.
	I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host
via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require
about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots
of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be
interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it 
would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use
an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then 
transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM
needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes
to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).
Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for
this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART
built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a 
company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain 
circuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.

   o 5mV/div
   o Component Tester (resistors/caps/diodes/coils)
   o TV video sync filter
   o z-axis input (intensity modulation)

'Broken' means: The CRT produces a nice, bright trace, but the trace does
not correspond to the input signal. My guess is it's repairable but more
than a simple calibration problem...but I honestly have not tried to
calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it. It's 'as-is'.
I paid $60 for it in its current state (I bought it thinking I'd repair it,
using the 'good' scope for side-by-side comparison...since I've sold the
'good' scope, the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good) and I'd like to recoup
that amount. As above, I'll accept offers and take the best one.

I'd prefer a local (Bay Area, California) buyer, so (a) I don't have to
ship it and (b) she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase.

How hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular 
Motorola microcontrollers.  I am a novice at microcontrollers, but I am
starting to get into them for some of my projects.  I have several 256k
SIMMs laying around from upgraded Macs and if I could use them as "free"
memory in one or two of my projects that would be great.  One project that
comes to mind is a Caller ID device that would require quite a bit of RAM
to store several hundered CID records etc...

My monitor display has a bad case of the wigglies. I have a good ground. I
live in an old house and I have replaced much of the wiring. I have two
EMI filters on the computer, the monitor plugs into the computer. When
fluorescent lights are on upstairs, the display jiggles, when motors run
in the house, the display jiggles, when incandescent lights are on in the
kitchen the display jiggles.  I could bring a separate line from the
breaker box, and use it only for the computer, would this do it? EMI
doesn't only travel the 110 volt line though. Should I shield the back of
the monitor? Ground a grid or plate? 
Your expertise is appreciated. Thanks very much!  Ed Byrnes

I was told that this is an environmental based move.  I was also told that
there will be 'somthing' else to replace the battery club.  Like maybe
the 360K floppy club ;-).

We'll see ....

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but
this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.
I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their
8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram
that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller
chips that "create static RAM appearance" and all that, but they may
be too expensive to make it worthwhile.

    as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this
country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot, and
then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually
steam) VERY HOT.

   I remember seeing this at Con Edison's Indian Point #1 power plant,
which is about 30 miles north of NYC, and built more or less 1958.

It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
protection.  (Poor you!)

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you 
souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of 
copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to 
the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the 
protection.

One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape 
for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an 
extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR 
first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I 
don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want 
to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.

Does anyone has a table about the size of the wire to the amount of current it can carry.  Probably in the 1-15amp range.  My friend is interested in converting a Mazda into an electric car.  Needed information for estimation.  Thanks in advance.

I need to reduce the speed of a Boxer fan by about 30-50%. I recall

The specifics; It's a real Boxer Fan (tm). The label says 115 V, .2 amps.

        On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures 
the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 
5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish 
to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor 
only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
 
                What could the problems be and what else could I use
to lower the input voltage?  (btw I've got it grounded correctly)

There usually is a way, however, often, telephone companies like to
keep all of their internal numbers private. Depends on your exchange.
Any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth
lines that echo the number you called from. The line service guys use this
to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines.

The switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when

Well, it's not an FTP site, but I got an 800 number for Signetics BBS.

The Signetics BBS contain some pretty good items for the 8051.  I am
currently using the following files which I downloaded from them:

    ml-asm51.zip      MetaLink's 8051 family macro assembler
    bootstrp.zip      Hex file Load-and-Go using 8051 uart
                      (allows you to download your program into a RAM
                       and then execute from RAM.  Works great.  Tell
                       me if you want more details).
    tutor51.zip       TSR for 8051 feature help screens
    
They have lots of coding examples, assemblers, and misc. tools.

Signetics BBS numbers are:    (800) 451-6644
                              (408) 991-2406

There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
voice telling you the number of the line.  Unfortunately, for the
life of me I can't remember what it is. The telephone technicians
use it all the time.  We used to play around with this in our
dorm rooms since there were multiple phone lines running between
rooms.

sorry!

HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
subjects. I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recieving
circuits. I understand a lot of things ,but a few things I am confused
abuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillator
frequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as
simple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across a
MC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs
(ACTIVE,etc...) 

Along the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone
may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.

P.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.
I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.

				Thanks,

				Mark Musone

Just a thought........Maybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it
IS an Emerson.  I've got an Emerson VCR which is #6 in the series.  Returned
it six times for various and never the same problems.  Got tired of taking it 
back and fixed it myself.  The Hi-Fi "window" was a bit off.  Something like
the Hi-Fi audio fine-tuning.  When I was a Wal-Mart "associate" in '88-'89,
we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY.  How's that for
reliability?  Face it--Emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premium
quality), but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with 
reliability IMHO.  Please, no flames.  Just *had* to share my Emerson disaster
in the light of this exploding tv.

The Fluke 87 beeps at you if you try to take it out of a current measuring
range while there is still a lead plugged in to the current sense socket.

... this should solve your problem - unless you are in a noisy environment.

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes
X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup.
You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the
serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted
onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does
something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative
prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely. I wonder
if ANYONE has ever managed to design a single sided PCB with an
8051, 573, EPROM, SRAM and >>NO LINKS<< ?
cheers
Mike.

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries
(you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost
one.

It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business 
or for an illegal use.  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or
police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no
other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. 

The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.
The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts
have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction
and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have
enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides
avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.

When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, 
explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an
association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector.
(I promise I am not making this up!)

I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any 
headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed 
laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund
raiser aspect of tickets.

Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is
probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle
busses running between the arena and the mall.

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA
office.  It should be free if you are an AAA member.

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly
good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?

A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the
WATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and
Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a
spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of
the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII
graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-
tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of
"tuning" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED.

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... 

Lindholm, L.E., and K.E. Oberg, "An Optoelectronic Instrument for Remote
On-Line Movement Monitoring", Biotelemetry, 1, 94-95, 1974.

Woltring, H.J., and E.B. Marsolais, "Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure-
ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report", Bull. Pros-
thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.

	Uh oh...
	Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  Some involve
modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new
ways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact
is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or
less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not
impossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,
assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,
legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy
protected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications, and are merely curious?
	Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I
can.

	Incidentally, the "Uh oh..." at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it
(from one side or the other.)

	Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part
because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure
of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just
exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products
is that this matches a hardware optimization.

	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has
TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)
so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can 
be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.
ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND
gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and
inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).

	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT
gates (with your choice of internal connections between the
various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum
of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into 
a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization
of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to
do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist
with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of
a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software
does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding
it all out, then simplifying.

Re: RMS readings

Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS
and but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring
average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves
(i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most)
any waveform, you need a "True-RMS" DVM/DMM which literally does the
Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.

The last significant advantage of analog (IMO) ** was ** being able to

Anymore, most DMM have bargraphs, etc. that duplicate this.

Hey all:

I just moved to NYC and wondered if there are any electronics hackers
out there who could point me to places in NYC that sell individual
electronic components (switches, pots, transformers, caps,
transistors, etc.)  "Radio Shack" doesn't count (they have almost no
selection, and their prices are outrageous!)

I have particular interest in audio components (amplifier IC's, power
MOSFETS, output transformers, tubes and tube sockets, pan pots,
faders, etc.)

I have checked out a lot of 48th street and Canal street so far with
no luck.  Am I missing places, looking in the wrong place, or do I
have to resort to mail order?

					thanks in advance,
					  --FritzM.

DEC did this on their new alpha chip.  I'm sure you could call them up
and ask them how they did it (haha).

Actually, there are some details in their article in IEEE Journal of
Solid-State Circuits.  I think it was sometime around Nov.  1992.

Has anyone ever heard of FET-TRONS (or is it FETRONS, FETTRONS, ...).
These were FET replacement modules for vacuum tubes. I'm looking for
applications where they were used.

FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles.

I need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to
deliver ~6 joules at 250 volts. This implies a 200uf cap. I have built
a very satisfactorily operating version from a MAX641, but do not like
the idea of using a $6 single source part. It seems that the ubiquitous
camera flash circuit is what I want, but I cant get mine apart without
breaking it. I would appreciate receiving the circuit description or
a source of one. I have already looked in several electronics circuits
handbooks to no avail. Thanx

	With relays alone, you will always get a transient when
you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear
the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator
is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,
THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.

	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors
in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few
thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which
drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices
are cheaper than relays.

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking
about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).

If this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current
flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the
house are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires
unless there is a fault condition.  Notice also that in the breaker box
there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,
usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.

Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get 
documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even 
support of some small degree.  Whatever you want to offer that is "better" 
than the circulating version.

It doesn't really hurt legit users.  Shareware is still much cheaper than 
the alternatives.

Can anybody recommend a good, application-oriented beginner's reference
to RF circuits?  

I am pretty good on theory & know what different types of modulation mean, 
but don't have a lot of practical experience.  A book detailing working
circuits of different types (modulation, power, frequency, what is legal,
what is not, et cetera), would be very helpful.

Thanks.

	Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your
mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big
current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output
nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.

(nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about
50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)

	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest,
6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company
name.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,
mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a
1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals.
If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info.

	Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida.
Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like 
nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices,
so they might be able to help you out.

	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.
The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd
need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......

I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet,
I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only
a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,
resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to
look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one
grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the
presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However,
you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.

The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as
much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets.
Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe
that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).

If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say
fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain
(I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9
months).

		  very much!)

PS: I have a question for you netters, I'm too afraid to refill with
the waterproof inks they sell in art-supply houses because I had brought
a bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge. I
wonder what is a 'good' waterproof ink (aside from buying refill-kits)
to refill my cartridge?

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that
something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently
don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing
cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests
are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the
video being piped into a command center they're building
somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or
cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large
multi-colored status displays will show the various routes
using different colors to represent the various average speeds
for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front
of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic
status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also
looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to
providing continuous audio from this system.

In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display
boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data
on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the
system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it
will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is
similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read
"cheap").

We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP
audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal
reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle
receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is
applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some
other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your
stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station
jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.
I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle
receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly
fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers
don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely
true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system
up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You
may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing
more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)

I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more
info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.

Hi people..

OK heres my problem.... 
I keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which
detect IR light....

I believe that you have to 'charge them up' under normal (visible) light
and then if they are exposed to IR light they glow or something like
that...

I think that they are avaliable in the states and even in England, but
alas I live in Australia.  Could someone please inform me if I can get
these things over here, and if so where??? and how much???

Also are they really commonly avaliable in the states, and if so, then
how much are they and who sells them (maybe if I cant get one here, I'll
write to one of the companies over seas..)

Anyway.... Thanks in advance...

Sounds like it is an SMD interface to me, not being at work now
to actually count pins.  there are two varients, SMD  and

I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say
what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say
how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for
months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are 
every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.
Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start
azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug
in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics
about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of 
disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it
is worth.  

I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good 
patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things
can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and
Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637

 Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but
in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use
that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because
long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.

A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive
pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to
fall every month. But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the 
ovule. Is it true ? If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine
pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian
tube ?

Sumatriptan(Imitrex) just became available in the US in a subcutaneous
injectable form.  Is there an oral form available in CA?  A friend(yes
really not me!)  has severe migranes about 2-3 times per week.  We
live right by the CA border and he has gotten drugs for GERD prescribed
by a US physician and filled in a CA pharmacy, but not yet FDA approved
in the US.  What would be the cost of the oral form in CA$ also if
anyone would have that info?    

Thanks




  I had this one time.  I attributed it to a lack of sleep since it disappeared
after a few nights of good zzz's.

I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  I don't
know why.  Perhaps because they weren't as profitable as cafergot.
Too bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients
and they don't do any good flushed down the toilet.  I suspect
we'll be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasal
spray, which is far more effective.

IMHO, the original poster has no business soliciting diagnoses off the net,
nor does Dr./Mr.  O'Donnell have any business supplying same. This is one
major reason real physicians avoid this newsgroup like the plague. It is
also another example of the double standard: if I as a physician offered
to diagnose and treat on the net, I can be sued. But people without
qualifications are free to do whatever they want and disclaim it all with
"I'm not a doctor."

Get and keep this crap off the net. Period.

Purists often distinguish between "true" clubbing and "pseudo"
clubbing, the difference being that with "true" clubbing the
angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly
negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).
With "pseudo" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then
negative, which is the normal situation. "Real" internists
can talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a couple
of minutes.

Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is
entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists
love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only "true" clubbing
is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of
diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes
both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of
these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems
leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is
very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the 
congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac
catheterization. 

The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to
some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to
dilate abnormally. 

Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is
a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,
the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.

Why do you think Steere is doing this?  Isn't he acting in good faith?
After all, as the "discoverer" of Lyme for all intents and purposes,
the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets.  I don't
see the ulterior motive here.  It is easy for me to see it the
those physicians who call everything lyme and treat everything.
There is a lot of money involved.

Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't
necessarily make you the most objective source of information
about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you
may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people
who may or may not have Lyme.  Certainly advocacy of more research
on Lyme would not be out of order, though, and people like you
can be very effective there.

I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of
mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot
of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years
(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from
painful experience:

  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.
     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more
     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.

  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear
     that these things will itch for months.

  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of
     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,
     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could
     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special
     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is
     required to get it.

  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old
     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall
     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers
     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I
     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some
     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.

  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.
     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally
     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is
     another preparation called "Chig Away" that is a combination of
     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was
     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In
     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get
     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we
     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They
     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur
     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)

  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget
     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment
     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone
     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine
     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.
     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this
     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think
     it gains nothing).

  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved
     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery
     as well.

Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban
doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors
seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I
suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers
would make a *lot* of money.

Yes, I remember that now.  Well, in that case, the cones are indeed

It isn't that rare, actually.  Many cases that are called Parkinson's
Disease turn out on autopsy to be SND.  It should be suspected in any
case of Parkinsonism without tremor and which does not respond to
L-dopa therapy.  I don't believe pallidotomy will do much for SND.

Several years ago I tried to commit a patient who was growing Salmonella out of his
stool, blood, and an open ulcer for treatment. The idea was that the guy was a
walking public health risk, and that forcing him to receive IV antibiotics for
a few days was in the public interest. I will make a long story short by saying
that the judge laughed at my idea, yelled at me for wasting his time, and let
the guy go.

I found out that tuberculosis appears to be the only MEDICAL (as oppsed to psychiatric)
condition that one can be committed for, and this is because very specific laws were
enacted many years ago regarding tb. I am certain these vary from state to state.

Any legal experts out there to help us on this?

Probably would not be fatal in an adult at that dose, but could kill
a child.  Patient would be very somnolent, with dilated pupils, low
blood pressure.  Possibly cardiac arrhythmias.

Compartment syndrome occurs when swelling happens in a "compartment"
bounded by fascia.  The pressure rises in the compartment and blood
supply and nerves are compromised.  The treatment is to open the
compartment surgically.  THe most common places for compartment
syndromes are the forearm and calf.  It is an emergency, since
if the pressure is not relieved, stuff will die.

The yearly chest x-ray provides a minute amount of radiation.  It is
a drop in the bucket as far as increased risk is concerned.  Who can
tell you whether you can get out of it or not?  No one here controls
that.  It may well be a matter of the law, in which case, write your

I attended high school in the San Jose, California area in the early 1980's,
and I remember a (smallish) outbreak of a strange illness, in which
people developed measles-like spots on their bodies.  This condition
seemed to last only a few days, and I don't recall anyone reporting any other
symptoms.  I seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have
been viral in nature, but I don't know for sure.

However, I have been curious since then about this.

Anyone have any ideas about what this might have been?

==============
Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues

    Mini outline:
        1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
        2. X terminals
        3. NeXT
        4. Silicon Graphics
        5. IBM RS/6000
	6. Other stuff

    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port

	If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
	(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding
	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation
	runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used
	PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable
	to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read
	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.

	The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.

	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and
	even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server
	extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your
	server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings
	appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,
	you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,
	or bugging your vendor.

	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.
	Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.

	Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.

    2. X terminals

	Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use
	PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all
	set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the
	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add
	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around
	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.

    3. NeXT

	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop
	Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they
	were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of
	upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!

    4. Silicon Graphics

	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and
	beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't
	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not
	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by
	upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more
	details.

    5. IBM RS/6000

	IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||
	Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||
	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||
	smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||
	it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||
	works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||
	told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||
	anything new, please send me e-mail.				    ||
    
    6. Other stuff

	Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)
	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your
	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can
	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either
	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in
	luck.  Contact the companies for more details.


Apple Adjustable Keyboard
    Apple Computer, Inc.
    Sales offices all over the place.

    Availability: February, 1993
    Price: $219
    Supports: Mac only

    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The
    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate
    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are
    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.

    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.
    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.

    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not
    directly attachable to the keyboard.

    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from
    TidBITS available there.


FlexPro Keyboard
    Key Tronic
    Phone: 800-262-6006
    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299
    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops

    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)
    Price: $489 (?)
    Supports: PC only (highly likely)

    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's
    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both
    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.
    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.

    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will
    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.

    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only
		   (3rd party support for Mac)

	Free software support for X windows is also available -- your
	PC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a
	serial cable or network.  The program is called a2x, and is
	available via anonymous ftp:

	soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z
	export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)

	If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want
	to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about
	this sort of thing.

    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.
    Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles
    (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you
    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.

    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions
    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple
    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file
    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.
    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between
    words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.
    I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.

    The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.
    The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

    Dragon's technology is also part of the following products
    (about which I have no other info):

	Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot)
	IBM VoiceType
	Voice Navigator II (by Articulate Systems -- for Macintosh)

    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles
    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is
    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod
    tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase
    "compatibility modules", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and
    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.

    It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the
    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each
    section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  Each section
    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three
    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each
    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections
    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

    The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the

You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make.
I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the
*process* of science and the end result.  

As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are
objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the
*process* of science.  

If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit
to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.
But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This
is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one
must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere
collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.

Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but
they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most
important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  
Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,
hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.
Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or
looking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really
good thinking beforehand.)  

The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre
scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  
It depends on the quality of their THINKING.  

It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that
they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical
studies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as
certain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, 
but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  

And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that
science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding
mistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  

--
In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

If you could not tell which one had MSG, why restaurants bother to
use it at all? 

If you can taste the difference, psychological reaction might play a role.

The fact is, MSG is part of natural substance. Everyone, I mean EVERYONE,
consumes certain amount of MSG every day through regular diet without
the synthesized MSG additive.

Chinese, and many other Asians (Japanese, Koreans, etc) have used
MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand years. Do you believe that
they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes? Not. They just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth.

Baring MSG is just like baring sugar which many people react to.

There's a pretty good article in the the March 6, 1993 New Scientist titled
"Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil".  The article states that research
has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the
disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with
AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement
seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients
who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.

I hope this is the correct newsgroup for this.

What is the scoop on Methanol and its future as an alternative fuel for
vehicles ?  How does it compare to ethanol ?

There was some news about health risks involved.  Anybody know about
that.  How does the US Clean Air act impact the use of Methanol by the
year 1995 ?

I think its Methyl Tertiary butyl ether which the future industries will
use as a substitute for conventional fuels.

There is company Methanex which produces 12% of the world's supply of
Methanol. Does anybody know about it ?

Please reply by e-mail as I do not read these newsgroups.

Well, certainly in Archimedes case the description "while observing the

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some
claim their heart "skipped" beats once in a while. Some reacted with
headache, some stomach ache. Some had watery eyes or running nose, some
had itchy skin or rashes. More serious accusations include respiration 
difficulty and brain damage. 

Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning. But
if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.

I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion. I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went
with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered
lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that
meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce.
I thought, "Well, I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor,
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch
another scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance.

Indeed, an extreme example.  It came "out of nowhere."  The connection
Kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary.
I, for example, often receive/conjure solutions (hypotheses for solutions) 
to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupied 
with activities quite removed.  Algorithms for that new software feature come
when I trample the meadow on my occasional runs.  Alternative (better>) ways 
to instruct and rear my sons arrive while I weed the garden.  I'll swear I am 
not thinking about any of it when ideas come.   

These ideas are not the stuff of "great" discoveries, of course, but my
connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and
occasional fits of rationality.

Yes.  And he was lucky to have such a colorful, vivid image.  I, alas, will
never figure out why returning worms to the loose soil of my garden brought, 
"have him count objects instead of merely count" to mind regarding my 2 
year-old's fledging arithmetic skills.

Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also 
widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. 
And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is 
indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  
perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might 
make that he is unable to even leave the house.  

In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible 
and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these 
discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata 
--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  

If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and 
Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither 
of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since 
they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of 
a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. 
It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid 
grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton 
and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great 
deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost 
through the mistakes they made.

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and
sci.psychology.  According to these posters  "If it's not supported by
carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science."

Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies 
are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification 
of science.  

For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology 
results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside 
the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have 
no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this 
is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, 
it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has 
certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish 
arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment 
--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come 
with anything worthwhile.  

Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is
one of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate
questions because they can be readily handled by the currently
fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional
or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to
those questions which seem to have fundamental significance.

For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with
statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.
(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many
areas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers
resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions
into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's
assertion that current scientific methods "avoid all known errors.")

I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental 
error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the 
others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all 
too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are 
worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.

Yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  You somehow left

You complain that people blame MSG automatically, since it's an unknown and
therefore must be the cause.  It is equally (if not more) unreasonable to
defend it, automatically assuming that it CAN'T be the culprit.

But why do you characterize this as a "flight of fancy" or a "fantasy"?
While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious
that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  This
does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of
fancy or a fantasy.

Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also,
"extra-scientific", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of
rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble
over what a "surprising" experiment is, what counts as "surprising", etc.
The same may be said about "logical grounds".  My point is that quite frequently
(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to
previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of
some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples
such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his "sea of air"
hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) "surprising"?
Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must
be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)
out of "perfectly rational grounds"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and
well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.
The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty
at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it "new"?  Well, one
could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new
domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you
like.

The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to
one of the hot questions of the day ('77).  He really had very little
reason to believe it, other than raw hope.  By fantasy, I certainly don't
mean Velikovskian manias.

I'm not familiar with the history of this experiment, although, arguably,
I should be.

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising.
That's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's
reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons,
but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be
impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if
it is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone
rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has
discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never
publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are
right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for
anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous
reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at
a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).

Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the
fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right
in the end.

I posted this to sci.psychology on April 3, and after seeing
your post here on panice disorder thought it would be
relevant.

-----

My research indicates that two schools of thought exist.
the literature promoting medication says it's the superior
treatment.  Not surprisingly, literature promoting cognitive
therapy also claims to be superior.

What are the facts?  Early in my research I didn't have a
bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy.  I
was interested in a treatment that worked.  After reading
journals published after 1986, the cognitive therapy camp
claims a higher success rate (approx 80%), a lower drop-out
rate, and no side effects associated with medication.

Lars-Goran Ost published an excellent article titled
"Applied Relaxation: Description of a coping technique and
a review of controlled studies."  This is from Behav. Res. Ther.,
vol. 25, no. 5, pp. 397-409, 1987.  The article provides
instructions on how to perform applied relaxation (AR).
Briefly, you start with two 15 minute sessions daily, and
progress in 8-12 weeks to performing 10-15 thirty second sessions
daily.

I'll snail mail this article to anyone interested (USA only please;
International please pay for postage).

Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and
subsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to
chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is
something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much
more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an
autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which
also leads to cirrhosis.  

Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous
effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. 
Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,
among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic
circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of
hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. 
These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in
men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for
cirrhosis is liver transplant.

Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in
your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the
subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he
or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to
you, and offer you support.

Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the
Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in
particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions
are particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the
blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,
which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,
especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less
sensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,
on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood
levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release
of steroids becomes flattened.

                    Hope this helps.

Shades of James Watson!  That's exactly the way many workers have described
their misgivings about the Human Genome Project.  If you take a rigid 
definition of scientific research, the mere accumulation of data is not 
doing science.  One of the early arguments against the project were that the 
resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related 
problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.  
The project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.



I have bad luck and got a VD called <Granuloma ingunale>, which involves
the growth of granules in the groin.  I found out about it by checking medicine
books and I found the prescriptions.  And I know I can just go to a clinic to
get it cured.  BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and
I think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves 
every day for two weeks for treatment.  Thus I bought the prescribed tablets
at some drugstore, but to cure it I must get INJECTION of <Streptomycin>, with
a dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days.  I can probably buy the 
tools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF
!
Can any kind people here tell me:

If it's possible to do it? Can I do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip
only??  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON!! (I am

   Well, if that's the case in YOUR practice, I have a hard time 
   figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
   of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons?
 
   If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,
   they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
   treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for
   fraudulent purposes.

   OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 1984
   ran the heading: "Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable by
   Drugs or Surgery," which has been echoed by several other reports.
   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, since
   the 20% magic of the "placebo effect" would award alternative 
   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine...

I attribute my success to several factors:

Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,
I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I
estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.

Very little sugar or salt.

Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are
recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard
of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can
contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as
likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are
just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)

My "clean your plate" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last
10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch
up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.

I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry
shortly, and eating won't be practical then).

I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to
stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.
I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps
build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes
runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my
metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable
with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if
it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess
ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that
weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim
weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)

There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically
different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,

I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.
I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,
my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes
off again over a week or two.

There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill.
That's the point, after all.

That's because these "peer-reviewed" studies are not addressing
the effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models.
You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
demonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argument
with a statement like "noting that animal administration has pro-
duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its
use in humans."  This is precisely NOT what you said.

It most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  You know, studies of
glutamate involve more than "food science".

So, point us to the studies in humans, please.  I'm familiar with
the literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all to
Olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.

>The point is exceeding the window. Of course, they're amino acids.
>Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.

Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a
essential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthy
without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
in the blood.

Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of
glutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this "projected safety
margin" is a construct derived from animal models and given that,
you can "prove" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy in
infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.

You mean "asserting".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or just
plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily
have anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potential
for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything
whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any
studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious
reasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon
of the "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".  It says nothing about the frequent
inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.

Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and
ability to insult people. You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician.
However, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific
research refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster sought
to start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. Given a little
effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is a
healthy practice. But we're not particularily interested in what you can
verbally prove/disprove or rationalize. Where's the research? Where are the
studies?

I appoligize if this sounds flamish. I simply would like to see the thread get
back on track.

Probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory
behind them.  E.G. homoeopathy: like cures like.  The more you dilute
things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much
there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness
stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such
systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental
and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism,
because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants
and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants
that have active and useful substances.  But that isn't what 
is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi,
accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that
probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.

Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience.
Rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal
and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that 
people don't want to be associated with that sort of thing.

But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I was
going to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly
the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily
concede that "ridiculous reasons" can play an important role in how
scientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with
methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the
majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are "blind" in various ways.  Some of these
are:

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
     control group or the test group.

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis
is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it.  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
the control and test groups are treated alike.

There is eye dominance same as handedness (and usually for the

Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to
restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts
to feel "puffy", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my
mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.

The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food
chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese
fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.

I am under the impression that MSG "enhances" flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.

Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)
involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is
what I suspect as being the cause.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals
showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab
rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.

Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied
they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder
of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the
tobacco companies still deny).

There turned out to be a very simple, conventional explanation for the
phenomenon.  I can't recall the details, but I believe it had to do with
the object between the plates altering the field because of purely
mechanical properties like capacitance.  The "aura" was caused by direct
exposure of the film from variations in field strength.

We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on  
Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent  
Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to  
encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our  
three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  
that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.


On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  
will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  
awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.

Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  
characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  
trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  
lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   
Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  
last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  
lifetime.  

Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  
of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  
Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  
support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  
newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  
in the prevention, cure, and treatment.

Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  
those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  
were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  
attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  
Foundation's mission is to change that. 

Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  
Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  
Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  
Princeton, or sent directly to:

Candida albicans can cause severe life-threatening infections, usually
in people who are otherwise quite ill.  This is not, however, the sort
of illness that you are probably discussing.

"Systemic yeast syndrome" where the body is allergic to
yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine.  There

Does anyone know the approximate prescription cost

Thanks.



My wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.  When
the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used
the ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was)

On her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if
they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
read the pictures.  The doctor very vehemently insisted that they
were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT!

My wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months
back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.

Should my wife be concerned?  Should we take the pictures to a 
radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find
such an expert in Chicago?)  We don't really have any special medical
reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the ob-gyn can't, then I don't see why we shouldn't use one.

Any thoughts?

	Ask the practitioner whether he uses the pre-sterilized disposable
needles, or if he reuses needles, sterilizing them between use.  In the
former case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles.  In
the latter case it's highly unlikely (though many practitioners use the
disposable variety anyway).

My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones. She says that because she has no
medical insurance, she cannot get them removed.

My question: Is there any way she can treat them herself, or at least mitigate
their effects? Any help is deeply appreciated. (Advice, referral to literature,
etc...)

Thank you,

What does a lack of taste of foods, or a sense of taste that seems "off"
when eating foods in someone who has cancer mean? What are the possible
causes of this? Why does it happen?

Pt has Stage II breast cancer, and is taking tamoxifin. Also has Stage IV
lung cancer with known CNA metastasis, and is taking klonopin (also had
cranial radiation treatments).

Thanks!

FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to
what the group is for......


A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....

This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),
antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and
so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned.

Oh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderated...too bad.

Oh well, obviously, no one really cares.

Bill Claussen


Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?

Listen: thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics.  If you have thrush, you have thrush, because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it, it generally
responds well, if you're not otherwise immunocompromised.  Noring's
anal-retentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here, nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have "candida" from reading a quack book.

So?

Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the

i'm shopping for a GP.  Might as well get a good one.

Could the Assembled Net Wisdom suggest things i should look for, or point me to

It likely has nothing to do with "chunks of plaque" but it sounds like
you may have a neurovascular compromise to your arm and you need medical
attention *before* doing any more weight lifting.

Ever heard of something called the placebo effect? I think Dyer is
reacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old
quackery over and over again.

It true that current medical knowledge is limited, but do you realize
just HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. It's playing the
lottery at best.

If the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mind
trying a little experiment to see if it is true? It would be quite
simple. Have sugar pills and have real pills.  Take one set for one
week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are
the real pills. Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results.
Let's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. If what you
are experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between
each week.

     The Center for Disease Control will launch a worldwide network to track 
the spread of infectious diseases and detect drug-resistant or new strains in 
time to help prevent their spread.  The network is expected to cost between 
$75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the Clinton 
administration's health reform  plan, according to the CDC and outside 
experts.  The plan will  require the CDC to enhance surveillance of disease in 
the United  States and establish about 15 facilities across the world to  
track disease.

     The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start  treating 
HIV-positive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion, resulting 
from recent findings that show HIV is  active in the body in large numbers 
much earlier than was  previously believed.  Anthony Fauci, director of the 
U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said, 
"We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly 
can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will 
get around microbial resistance."  He said any delay would signify questions 
over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co-
authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the  
argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery 
indicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time 
and money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were 
infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of 
Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument 
for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the 
new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand 
the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  "We've known about this 
for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain," said Jesse 
Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.  But Peter Duesberg, who  
believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug  abuse in the 
West, said, "We are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of AIDS--even 
if these papers are right."

"Risk of AIDS Virus From Doctors Found to Be Minimal" Washington Post 
(04/14/93), P. A9 

     The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care  
professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in 
today's Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA).  This finding 
supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of 
contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the 
JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive 
surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies 
were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and 
Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and 
tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found 
that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  
HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.  In Maryland, 413 of 1,131 
patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  Johns Hopkins Hospital 
were found to be HIV-negative.  Similarly  in Florida, 900 of 1,192 dental

patients, who all had been  treated by an HIV-positive general dentist, were 
tested and found to be negative for HIV.  The Florida researchers, led by 
Gordon  M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine, said, 
"This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from  a general 
dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal 
precautions are strictly observed."   Related Story: Philadelphia Inquirer

"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program" AIDS 
Treatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) 

     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of 
Health has raised questions about the NIH's commitment to an  effort that uses 
unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of 
the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 
billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available 
research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be 
available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for 
Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid 
to become involved in AIDS.  "They have to look successful and there is no 
easy answer in AIDS," she said.    There is also a common perception that the 
OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, 
such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an 
advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS 
community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' 
general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic 
will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, "The OAM advisory 
panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  
will take them several years to accept the nature of research."   
Nevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator 
at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, "Here is a 
wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the 
Office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much 
more [than  public relations]."

"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, 
No. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) 

     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-
6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack 
causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in 
the immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a 
factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lusso's research  
found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte, 
which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can

kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural 
killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  
research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural 
killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony 
L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube 
findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the 
body.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  
molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface 
receptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that 
herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.

     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only 
ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health 
problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert 
and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, 
Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  
respectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care 
about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for 
the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should 
be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it 
is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  
respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic 
development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  
Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have 
on many developing countries, and the increased need for international 
assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political 
aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there 
is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach 
to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in 
particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book "Earth in the 
Balance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable 
international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child 
survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the 
developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  
change the future of worldwide health.

Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) 

     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible 
before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less 
attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller 
Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and 
Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as 
malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  
economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention 
than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is 
receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most 
developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic 
diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another 
year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS 
and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden 
but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a 
rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each 
individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley 
says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  
economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he 
concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the 
United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries 
with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  
has been the rule.

        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children


The National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental 
HIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. 

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 
children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-
infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. 

HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a 
hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected 
children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS." 

Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial "is 
the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay 
disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick."  If these 
vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their 
therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in 
the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health 
Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. 

The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which 
funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial 
at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the 
ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development. 

Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows 
that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and

stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers 
know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. 

The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined 
closely for other reasons as well.  "This trial will provide the first insight 
into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines," said 
Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  "We need this 
information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent 
HIV infection in children." 

In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city 
areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. 

Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during 
pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than 
a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing 
numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection 
drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding 
increase in the numbers of infected children. 

HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  
The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV 
develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These 
infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of 
childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms 
leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. 

At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger 
to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older 
participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no 
symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen 
liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-
regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. 

Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical 
School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of 
Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical 
officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. 

"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children 
for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or 
fevers, for example, than another," said Dr. McNamara.  "We'll also look at 
whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other 
significant laboratory or clinical effects."   He emphasized that the small 
study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three

products. 

The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from 
recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically 
engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-
tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. 

One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a 
protein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  
Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is 
the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 

Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco 
and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in 
Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus 
adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine 
contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in 
other Phase I vaccine trials in adults. 

A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 
children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the 
experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, 
considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will 
be told what they receive. 

If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the 
experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will 
begin. 

Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six 
months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

           NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE HIV CAN CAUSE DISEASE INDEPENDENTLY
              News from the National Institute of Dental Research

There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease 
independently of its ability to suppress the immune system, say scientists at 
the National Institues of Health. 

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling 
skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the 
HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' 
immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV 
itself caused the skin disease. 

Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease 
without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the 
National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues 
described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human 
Retroviruses. 

Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most 
animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this 
problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for 
HIV as well as their own genetic material. 

NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse 
eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters 
contained both normal and transgenic animals. 

Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV 
genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon 
after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an 
incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. 

Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their 
necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin 
lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No 
skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. 

Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a 
type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can 
cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the 
animals. 

Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the 
presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned 
on," or active, said Dr. Kopp. 

The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the 
mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common 
infections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune 
systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the 
skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. 

Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists 
exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV 
genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  
Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the 
genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No 
lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. 

The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter 
Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases. 

Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. 
Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; 
Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, 
formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS
                                H H S   N E W S
                 ********************************************
                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

                                 March 4, 1993


     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide 
clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care 
professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV 
infection or AIDS. 
     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a 
physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on 
drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is 
funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of 
San Francisco General Hospital. 
     Secretary Shalala said, "One goal of this project is to share expertise 
so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health 
care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces 
treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and 
community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients 
with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience." 
     Secretary Shalala said, "This clinical expertise should be especially 
helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in 
communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available." 
     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and 
it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) 
Monday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer 
questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and 
health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be 
answered as quickly as possible. 
     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question 
related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment 
information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, 
literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health 
care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate 
sources of information or materials. 
     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken 
by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse 
practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and 
inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant 
asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current 
medications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. 
     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern 
California.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health 
Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and 
by the American Academy of Family Physicians. 
     "When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of 
care they are able to provide to their patients," said HRSA Administrator 
Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  "This project will be a great resource for 
health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve." 
     "This service has opened a new means of communication between health care 
professionals and experts on HIV care management," said HRSA's associate 
administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources 
Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  "Providers who treat people with 
HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment 
methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS." 
     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.

Good grief; has no one ever heard of Biostatistics??  The University of
Washington (plus 3 or 4 others [Harvard, UNC]) has a department and
advanced degree program in Biostatistics.  My wife has an MS Biostat, and
there are plenty of MDs, PhDs, and postdocs doing Biostatistical work.
People do this for a living.  Really bright people study for decades to do
this sort of study well.

Anecedotal evidence is worthless.  Even doctors who have been using a drug
or treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised
at the results of clinical trials.  Whether or not MSG causes describable,
reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.  

The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors,
and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  I
would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS
student in a thesis.

Hello,

I am interested in trying this "desensitization" (?) method
against hay fever.
What is the state of affairs about this. I went to a doctor and
paid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to the
diagnostic that I am allergic to (June and Timothy) grass.
I believe this. From now on it looks like 2 shots per week for
6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. Each shot costs
$20. Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system, I would
call that a racket. We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses
here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office.
Apart from this issue, I was somewhat disappointed to find out
that you have to keep getting the shots forever. Is that right?
Thanks for information.

Isn't this what HIV is about - the "normal immune response" to an exposure?

I had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back.  The needles were taken
from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly NOT
sterile or even clean for that matter.  More than likely they were fresh
from the previous patient.  I WAS concerned, but I kept my mouth shut.  I
probably should have raised hell!

Any comments?  No excuses.



What resources and services are available on Internet/BITNET which
would be of interest to hospitals and other medical care providers?
I'm interested in anything relelvant, including institutions and
businesses of interest to the medical profession on Internet,
special services such as online access to libraries or diagnostic
information, etc. etc.

   The following is from a critique of a "60 Minutes" presentation on MSG
   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS
   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]

	"Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes' last November
	3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In
	the segment entitled 'No MSG,' for instance, show host Ed Bradley
	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them
	('millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently
	sick'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven
	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the
	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive 
	those studies are.

	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to
	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order
	to back up his comment that there is 'a lot of evidence' that MSG,
	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as
	in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT
	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on
	humans but on rabbits.

	One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist
	Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that
	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get 
	headaches from it.  'But,' she explains, 'the show probably 
	overemphasized the extent of the problem.'

	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor
	at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley
	remarks, 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory
	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters' because
	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney's
	research with lab animals does not 'show' anything about human
	youngsters.

	In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney's 
	experiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected
	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing 
	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,
	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance
	to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither
	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG 
	with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by
	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little
	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human
	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations
	found in Dr. Olney's lab animals.....

	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of
	that fact.  And so does the European Communities' Scientific
	Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,
	have concluded that MSG is safe.

	Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never
	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed
	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a
	burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe
	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently
	exonerated the much-maligned substance.

	That's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of
	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever
	we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one
	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken
	down into glutamate during digestion.

	It's a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the
	most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes
	up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in
	milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.

	That doesn't mean it's entirely unimaginable that a small number
	of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore
	sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international
	professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus
	reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large."

clinic director, and complain. Whatever their attitude, they have nothing to
gain from angering patients.

Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'm
certainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I
agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation
can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.

Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough
caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,
the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be
realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.
Therefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common
inflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,
of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:

Completely out - never again - items:
	o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)
	o popcorn (same)
	o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins
	o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)

Discouraged greatly:
	o raw vegetables (too fibrous)
	o wheat and raw grain breads
	o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)
	o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)
	o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)
	o long grain and wild rice (husky)
	o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)
	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing

I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this
day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your
system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the
NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try
the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!
Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the
daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more
thoroughly - you're mileage may vary.

As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  But
this is the info I've been given, and it may be a starting point for
discussion.  Good luck!

Dr Singla, you might contact Kaiser Health Plan either in the area
closest to you or at the central office in Oakland CA.  We have been
doing QA, QoS, concurrent UR, and TQM for some time now in the Hawaii
Region, and I suspect it is nationwide in the system.

Hi,

we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance, and have a
wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use
to adjudicate a contract next week.

Although the output data is easy for us to present, there seems to be
little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for
straightforward inhalation therapy (eg: for asthmatics).

Some say that the droplets must be smaller than 5 microns, whilst
others say that if they are too small they will not be effective.

Anyone up on this topic who could summarise the current status ?

Cheers,
Pete

The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little 
fat.  I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick
it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just
have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch
to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it
still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  
muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be
best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although
some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent 
irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, 
wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the
puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent
irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to
do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the 
spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,
and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 " apart.)

This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have
diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)

For those of you interested in the above Procedure, I am able to add the
following facts:

1) This Procedure is not done in Philadelphia.

2) It is performed in Maryland at Johns Hopkins for corrections between
   0 and -5 and from -10 to -20 (diopters, I think are the units).

3) It is performed in New York City at Manhattan Eye and Ear for corrections
   between 0 and -6.

The magic words to use when requesting information on this is not PRK (they

Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is
being a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,
other people shouldn't say so?  Can you give an example of a
commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,
or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
need to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of
people.

I don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to 
promote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... It 
pleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort of 
validated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but the 
practice was different....oh.
	If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of 
the national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very 
sure of the validity of your philosophy. I believe in 1946, the NHS was 
still having its nurses taught the fine art of "cupping", which is the 
vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing 
it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool.
	I wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath.

I can't answer most of your questions, but I've seen it happen in 
family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.
Jory Graham published a cookbook many years ago (in cooperation with 
the American Cancer Society, I think) called "Something has to taste
good" (as I recall).

The cookbook was just what we needed several times when favorite foods
suddenly became "yech".

Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year.  It is still
partially frozen, and I am still in physical therapy every week.  But the
pain has subsided almost completely.  UNTIL last week when I mowed the
lawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row.  I have a push type power
mower.  The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite
a while, and I used ice and medicine again.  Can anybody explain why this
particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally,
should cause this shoulder problem?

Thanks.

I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the "Yeast Connection"
that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.  Of course, they are
working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus
membrane tissue with associated "mild" inflammatory response can and does
occur in a large number of people.  If you reject this "yeast hypothesis",
then I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic
endeavor.  Stay tuned.

 Nobody is saying that you shouldn't be allowed to use msg.  Just
don't force it on others. If you have food that you want to 
enhance with msg just put the MSG on the table like salt.  It is
then the option of the eater to use it.  If you make a commerical
product, just leave it out. You can include a packet (like some
salt packets) if you desire.

Salt, pepper, mustard, ketchup, pickles ..... are table options.
Treat MSG the same way.  I wouldn't shove my condiments down your
throat, don't shove yours down mine.

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is
about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar
Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources
(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
uranium reached $200/lb.

"Demand and supply balance will collapse" is nonsense.  Supply and
demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going
to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?
Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built
at a sufficient rate.

Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or
a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of
self-sufficiency.

I don't think Northrup ever had a plant on Long Island.  The two main airframe

T-46 cancellation, and Grumman (which is still hanging on last I time I called).
I think Sperry also started there.  If you're ever in the area check out the

Definitely! In one of the reports of an early test conducted by Rocketdyne at

First I've heard of it. Offhand:

Griffin is no longer an "office" head, so that's bad.

On the other hand:

Regress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by Griffin, because
that would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a
mission to Mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be
no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...

They were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants
somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
the same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's
a communist hardliner.

At least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward
won't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
ghetto. That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
good. And if he brings something up, noone can say "why don't you go
back to the OSE where you belong" (and where he couldn't even get money
for design studies).

certain parts of a space station that is built and designed and such by a
commerical company or consortium of companies (such as like Alyeska) for a
small amount of rent in return for certain incentives and such.. Such as tax
and other right off and also a monopoly on certain products.. The commerical
builders would have certain perks given to them to make there end easier (taxes
, contracts, regulatory concesions and such..)

Is it workable, just might work..

After all, if China can lease out Hong Kong and the people of Hong Kong can
make money, this could work..

Fabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may go

a bomb, don't use plutonium, use uranium.

The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically.

For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit
noise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines
and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite
that simple.

Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.

The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially
practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings
are also not very comfortable.  However, in the words of Georgy Grechko,
"I prefer to have bruises, not to sink."

I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
first and second grade (69-70, 70-71).  They came in Chocolate,
strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long
and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed
like space foil at the time).  

The taste is hard to describe, although I remember it fondly.  It was
most certainly more "candy" than say a modern "Power Bar."  Sort of
a toffee injected with vitamins.  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough
approximation of the taste.  Strawberry sucked.

Man, these were my "60's."

"Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be
Impossible"

Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the
headline shown above. The article starts with "A leader
of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned
space station said yesterday the job is tough and may
be impossible." O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is
possible to cut costs that much and still provide for
meaningful research "is a real question for me."
O'Connor said "everything is fair game," including
"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the
aerospace industry, chopping management of the space
station program at some NASA facilities around the
country, working closely with the Russian space station
Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the
manned space shuttle fleet."

O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options
so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates
into three categories based on cost.

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived
from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe
Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I
listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press
on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor
talked about how the White House wants three options,
sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part
of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has
formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,
modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch
Core ["wingless Orbiter"] @ JSC. Later, in response to
a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say
the option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"
cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not
the "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).

The article goes on to describe the other two options
as "one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle -
the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."

The last sentence in the article contradicts the title
& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He
[O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned
space station Freedom is still possible within the
administration's budget guidelines."




I was wondering if the FAQ files could be posted quarterly rather than monthly.  Every 28-30 days, I get this bloated feeling.

In the April edition of "One Small Step for a Space Activist",
Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:
  "Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes
   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like
   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the
   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts
   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the
   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to
   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about
   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10
   billion won't be spent on anything having anything
   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion
   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done
   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting
   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the
   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the
   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are
   getting and the price they are paying and note that
   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware
   that a third of the money is going for something else."

My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple
of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I
talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station
at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a
response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed
to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz
data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend
in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers 
Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF
to 15,000 science teachers.]

First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does
exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'
for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.
This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4
center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at
$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is
04/2.2 = 1.8%

Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30
billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to
$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I
will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket
change.

I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could
be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some
states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it
take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*
subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in
front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds
go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax
rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the
center, and not to the prime contracts.

This leads to the obvious question "What is the government
doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?
(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A
big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens
to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten
up by the center tax?)"

At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting
development funds (as they are supporting the development
work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to
setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical
power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life
solar array field (left over from solar cell research
research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries
(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC
switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated
loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system.

We have also used the supporting development money to
purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life
testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in
Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone.
38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the
on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).

As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations, for performing system
analyses (like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system, availability calculations
using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a 
database with information on weight of the power
system elements).

Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all
go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director
does control a small discretionary fund. Each year,
any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.

Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'
services at the Center, like the library, the 
central computer services division, the Contractor 
who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get
an accurate figure, you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library (for example),
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support SSF (which would be hard to
compute by itself - how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for
1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on
the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week
versus the rest of the center personnel). You would
then have to compare this estimate of the SSF
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,
maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but
we underpay for snow removal? Talk about
a burecratic nightmare!

My last point is that I can't believe your claim that
Congress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'
Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before
Congress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simple
word search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,
in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods
were documented for Congress?

You mean like: seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years. . .  :-)

Remember,  the Fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale.  Some
revisionists tell the history something like this:  The coldest point in a
particular Russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body
temperature of a volunteer (turns out he was sick, but you can't win 'em all).
Then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into
hundredths.

 My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny
 masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the
 problem.   Or, to put it more technically, the extra "volume" they add
 to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.
 
 Jupiter is 2E27 kg, while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23.
 
 Also, as I said, the few references that I've looked at do not
 mention outgassing or breakup as important processes.  The important
 thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet "reverse slingshot" that leads to a
 weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).

Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director

                                GALILEO
                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                             POST-LAUNCH
                         April 9 - 15, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)
swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.

2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.

3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data; long term trend analysis is continuing.

6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level.

7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.
Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.

8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads
19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 260 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21
(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was
not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of
the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)
	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km

SPECIAL TOPIC

1.  As of April 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65076  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.
In the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated in
the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.
Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference,
uplink the EJ-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer.

Sorry folks, I should have done this, and meant to just after i hit the 
send key...

Orbital Elements of Comet 1977VII (from Dance files)

p(au)          3.424346
e              0.151899
i              1.0988
cap_omega(0) 243.5652
W(0)         231.1607
epoch       1977.04110

Also, perihelions of Gehrels3 were:

April  1973     83 jupiter radii
August 1970     ~3 jupiter radii

Hope this helps...I'm even less of an orbital mechanic than I am an artist.

In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on
a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid
motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of 
aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent
Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.
The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect
some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made
a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what
you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The
foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,
so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major
improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the
principal failure mode for solid propellant.

The difficulties of a high Isp OTV include:
Long transfer times (radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both
 the spacecraft and OTV
Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have
to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of
radiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy)
that make attitude control and docking a big pain.

If you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with
current technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted
by international treaty.

Refueling (even for very high Isp like xenon) is still required and]
turn out to be a pain.

You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation
to do docking or    ( and refueling) .

You still can't do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!

The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though. I suppose
they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and
the problems get solved.  Not impossible in principle, but hard to
do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.

Just a few random thoughts on high Isp OTV's. I designed one once...

Hello everyone,

	I was hoping someone could help me out.  I'm writing a program
	for my astronautics class for assent of the shuttle into a low

Old pioneer song from the 1850's or so goes as follows:
  
  "In a cavern, in a canyon,
   Excavating for a mine,
   Dwelt a miner, forty-niner,
   And his daughter, CLEMENTINE"
  
Chorus:
  "Oh my darling, Oh my darling,
   Oh my darling Clementine.
   You are lost and gone forever,
   Oh my darling Clementine."
  
 I've also had it explained (but not confirmed from a reliable data
source) that CLEMENTINE is an acronym.  Something like Combined
Lunar Elemental Mapper Experiment on Extended Non Terrestrial
Intercept Near Earth.  Personally, I think that acronym was made up
to fit the name (if it really is an acronym).

  I found it very interesting that Atlas depended on pressure to
maintain tank geometry....leads me to the question: ? have any 
of the SSTO concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the
launch configuration would be significantly different from the
reentry one?  I have long been facinated by pnumatic structures
as conceived and built by Frei Otto and others, a "ballon" tank
SSTO sounds very clever. 




Last I had heard because of budget and such the Air Farce is the only "Space
Command" left.. The rest missions were generally given to the Air Farce..

Probably a good reason for me to transfer from the Army Guard to the Air
Guard..

If you are really interested in these orbits and how they are obtained
you should try and find the following paper:

     Hiroshi Yamakawa, Jun'ichiro Kawaguchi, Nobuaki Ishii, 
     and Hiroki Matsuo, "A Numerical Study of Gravitational Capture
     Orbit in the Earth-Moon System," AAS-92-186, AAS/AIAA Spaceflight
     Mechanics Meeting, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 1992.

The references included in this paper are quite interesting also and 
include several that are specific to the HITEN mission itself.

Wow.  I was beginning to think that I had made that up.  I remember that
movie (it was about 1.5 hours long).  I don't think they ended up anywhere
in the known universe.  

I remember they got a message halfway out to Proxima Centauri, that Earth
transmitted a day after they launched, timed to catch up with them at the
halfway point.  I thought it was neat, I think I was all of 10 at the time.

Space:1999 has just come out with 4 episodes released in American stores.
I will look for the Into Infinity show, I never did know that was the
name of it, I thought the show was called "the day after tomorrow", and
that was it.

Announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post
you stated that the "wrap" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.
Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.

Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum
attack and you know it.

Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and "wrap" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true. Which is it Allen?

As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.
Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.

Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There
is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo?

Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just

I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called
leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership
and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of
leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this.

No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have

I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to 
change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
your position.

I'm an advocate of this idea for funding Space Station work, and I
throw around the $1 billion figure for that "reward."  I suggest that
you increase the Lunar reward to about $3 billion.

This would encourage private industry to invest in space, which 
should be one of NASA's primary goals.

It wasn't especially prominent, as I recall.  However, quite possibly it's
no longer on display; NASM, like most museums, has much more stuff than it
can display at once, and does rotate the displays occasionally.

There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space
station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the
Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and
the Museum of Science and Industry.

Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United
States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by
the Planetary Studies Foundation.

The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring
Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President
of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9
which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June
17.

The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials,
continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest
tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an

Low-Cost Lunar Access: A one-day conference to explore the means and 
benefits of a rejuvenated human lunar program.

Friday, May 7, 1993
Hyatt Regency - Crystal City Hotel
Arlington, VA

ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
The Low-Cost Lunar Access conference will be a forum for the exchange of
ideas on how to initiate and structure an affordable human lunar program.
Inherent in such low-cost programs is the principle that they be 
implemented rapidly and meet their objectives within a short time
frame.

[more deleted]

CONFERENCE PROGRAM (Preliminary)

In the Washington Room:

  9:00 - 9:10 a.m.     Opening Remarks

Thanks for typing that in, Steven.  Sounds like a "fall back and
regroup" strategy session.

I wanted to add that my copy of the brochure arrived with a flattering
cover letter:

"Invitations are being extended to those who have demonstrated a
strong committment to space program development and have been
influential in its advancement.  We sincerely hope you will be able to
attend."

Wow! I wonder which of my contributions to the conquest of space
convinced them to send me this letter?

I hope you decide to go, Pat.  The Net can use some eyes and ears
there...

Will this mean a loss of data or will the Magellan transmit data later on ??

BTW: When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan?? Not that I am
looking forward to that day but I am just curious. I believe it had something
to do with the funding from the goverment (or rather _NO_ funding :-)

ok that's it for now. See you guys around,

At one time there was speculation that the first spacewalk 
(Alexei Leonov ?) was a staged fake.

Has any evidence to support or contradict this claim emerged ?

Was this claim perhaps another fevered Cold War hallucination ?

Sure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They're listed in the sci.space
Frequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt.

    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail
    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend
    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the
    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth
    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics
    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. Contributing Associate,
    minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).

	World Space Foundation
	Post Office Box Y
	South Pasadena, California 91301

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert
Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),
and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something
to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as
quite a few references.


Check the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society*:

V36 p. 201-209 (1983)
V36 p. 483-489 (1983)
V37 p. 135-141 (1984)
V37 p. 491-494 (1984)
V38 p. 113-119 (1984)
V38 p. 133-136 (1984)

(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of
reprints? I just found the file.)

And K. Eric Drexler's paper "High Performance Solar Sails and Related
Reflecting Devices," AIAA paper 79-1418, probably in a book called
*Space Manufacturing*, maybe the proceedings of the Second (?)
Conference on Space Manufacturing.  The 1979 one, at any rate.

   Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The
   chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
   dominance in the marketplace.

Darn, caught by the white hot heat of technological progress again...

   Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced
   white lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the
   metal.

   Which merely evades the issue of why those lunatics are
   there at all (and, why their children would want to stay.)

I did not evade the issue at all. I clearly stated that
this would be from diabolical foresight in establishing
a sheltered industrial base for the upcoming Great War ;-)

Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..
Why not?? If you can put them on "safe" "pause" mode.. why not have them be
activated by a signal from a space craft (manned?) to act as a naviagtion
beacon, to take a directional plot on??

Wierd or what?

There is a whole constellation of custom built navigation beacon satellites
in the process of being phased out right now. The TRANSIT/OSCAR satellites
are being replaced by GPS. Or were you thinking of deep space navigation,
which is best done with doppler/VLBI/ stellar measurements. I do not think
additional radio beacons would help much.

In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, I think their
cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO
is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G
range.

True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I
don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
risks involved.

If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures
100% of the available launch market, then I think you could
do it.

I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the
software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically
correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking
care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited
the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He
also noted that the software people were starting to feel management
pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)

Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things
right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure
during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.
As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted
on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.

As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.
Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the
experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.

The face and the Viking landing sites will be targeted by the high-resolution

Unfortunately, if you launch this from the US (or are a US citizen),
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space
Transportation, and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for
an antisatellite weapon... :-)

The threshold at which OCST licensing kicks in is roughly 100km.
(The rules are actually phrased in more complex ways, but that is
the result.)

For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel
for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the
contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be
worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest
heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I
don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.

But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a
low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General
Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two
unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. 
Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9
billion for the US share.

I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that
its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric
tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew
habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for
the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be
able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,
that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors
eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or
college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round
this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton
payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two
LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a
year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of
delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone
have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and
equipment would weigh?

And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded
to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? 
Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10
engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? 
I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
DC-1.

All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the
moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first
non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned
moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find
some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal
might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary
about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd
like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.

Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an
English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on
the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar
flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. 
Does this ring a bell to anyone?

Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):

There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its
rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's some
information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay
Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to
learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have
some money available...

John Spencer, 1993/04/21

Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn
itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,
(21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;

     1993 May 1-2

        A-ring ingress  18:27
               egress   19:30
        B-ring ingress  19:51
               egress   21:42
        C-ring egress   23:00
        Saturn ingress  23:59
               egress   10:02
        B-ring ingress  10:28
               egress   12:19
        A-ring ingress  12:40
               egress   13:43

     1993 July 20-21

        Saturn ingress  21:16
               egress   05:08
        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)
               egress   09:38

Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,
and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'
orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from
Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about
the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy
and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell
of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my
attention.

THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?

Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:

  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July
  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,
  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,
  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3
  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with
  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something
  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.

  Jay

and again:

  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet
  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would
  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and
  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a
  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't
  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are
  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One
  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.

You have missed something.  There is a big difference between being in
the SAME PLANE and in exactly the same state (positions and velocities
equal).  IN addition to this, there has always been redundancies proposed.

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the
spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available, or you need to retrain a new team.

Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.
Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA 
series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.
Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode for
use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap.

Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time.

In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.

What I was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be
possible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes
for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the
sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.  

I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in
that essentially says "If you never hear from Earth again,
here's what to do."  This was a back up in the event a receiver
burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but
still some data).

Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for
startup, if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe, it might
not be such a big loss.  Obviously you can't plan for
everything, but the most obvious things can be considered.

In fact, you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring NASA 
altogether.  The rocket is a commercial launch vechicle - a Conestoga flying 
a COMET payload.  NASA is simply the primary customer.  I believe SDIO has a
small payload as well.  The advertising space was sold by the owners of the
rocket, who can do whatever they darn well please with it.  In addition, these

I think its only fair to find that out before everyone starts having a hissy

it has not yet been approved.

Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral
exploration.

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth..
You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.

There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so
expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or
tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends 
of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of
the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there
normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and
other expenses you can owe more than what you made.
BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe
600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And
the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. 

Basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go
cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the
eco-freaks or the protectionist.. 
Such fun we have in these interesting times..

A related question (which I haven't given that much serious thought 
to): at what lattitude is the average length of the day (averaged 
over the whole year) maximized? Is this function a constant=
12 hours? Is it truly symmetric about the equator? Or is
there some discrepancy due to the fact that the orbit is elliptic
(or maybe the difference is enough to change the temperature and
make the seasons in the southern hemisphere more bitter, but
is far too small to make a sizeable difference in daylight
hours)?

I want to know where to move.

 Besides this was the same line of horse puckey the mining companies claimed
when they were told to pay for  restoring land  after strip mining.

they still mine coal in the midwest,  but now it doesn't look like

If raw materials where to cost enough that getting them from space would
be cost effective then the entire world economy would colapse long
before the space mines could be built.

Press Release No.19-93
Paris, 22 April 1993

Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of
their experiments

"Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not
be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided
a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s". This
summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300
participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in
Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by
the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for
the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).

OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :
-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of
       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small
       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested
       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,
       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few
       examples.

-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services
       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-
       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over
       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.

-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS
       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,
       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and
       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.

When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the
world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other
satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four
different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.

OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some
of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is
given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or
services; over the past four years some 200 companies and
organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over
100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning
organisation.



As the new technologies and services tested by these
OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then
make use of operational satellites such as those of
EUTELSAT.

OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,
when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the
end of its design life.

DFW was designed with the STS in mind (which really mean very little).  Much of
their early PR material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three
others pulled up to gates.  I guess they were trying to stress how advanced the
airport was.

For Dallas types:  Imagine the fit Grapevine and Irving would be having if the
shuttle WAS landing at DFW. (For the rest, they are currently having some power
struggles between the airport and surrounding cities).

 ========================================================================
A couple of points on this thread.

1. We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger
   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.

2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is
   not dependent on "sophisticated tools"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools
   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle
   Language) is somewhat limited.

3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated "Level 5" by a NASA team.
   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.

4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info
   on our software development process.

Allen, sometimes I think you're OK.  And sometimes you tend to rashly leap into
making statement without thinking them out. 

Wanna guess which today?

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff.  Do you know 
of a private Titan pad?

	I've heard of sillier things, like a well-known utility company
wanting to buy an 'automated' boiler-cleaning system which uses as many

more per unit. Automation is more 'efficient' although by what scale they are

                                 GALILEO
                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                               POST-LAUNCH
                           April 16 - 22, 1993


SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test
and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were
performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter
antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis
is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed
information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.

3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)
advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone
70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees
to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.

5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance
measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC
measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and
currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with
the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.

6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 184 hours


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)
	Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds


SPECIAL TOPIC

1.  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.
In the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in
the sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command
process. The only command activity was a command to reset the command loss
timer.

No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible
near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those
discussions, a
spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to 
some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with
it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on 
the sensors that might be carried.

Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle
would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --
certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA
for, e.g.,  launch support would probably 
cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.

No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per 
Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to 
see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, 
the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure
would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was
(or a parade balloon, for that matter).

While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got
a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived
intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting
only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly
draw attention to space.

I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.
Commercial projects, however, generally don't get "funding" -- they
get "customers" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.

You may change that to 100% certainty.  But to clarify, Spacewatch is a
University of Arizona project using a telescope of the Steward Observatory
located on Kitt Peak.  It is not associated with Kitt Peak National
Observatory, other than sharing a mountain.

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume
no new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, with
lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to
build something HLV-sized anyway.

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans.  It
doesn't take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster, all of which
would have far better cost-effectiveness.

Sorry, not so -- the changes in sunrise and sunset times are not
quite synchronized.  For example, neither the earliest sunrise nor the
latest sunset comes on the longest day of the year.

You can derive day length from sunrise and sunset times, but not
vice-versa.

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)
As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort (let alone anything else)

  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.

  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume. 

  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that...

Oh, and us with the big degrees don't got imagination, huh?

The alleged dichotomy between imagination and knowledge is one of the most
pernicious fallacys of the New Age.  Michael, thanks for the generous
offer, but we have quite enough dreams of our own, thank you.

You, on the other hand, are letting your own dreams go to waste by
failing to get the maths/thermodynamics/chemistry/(your choices here)
which would give your imagination wings.

Writer Kathy Sawyer reported in today's Washington Post that Joseph Shea, the 
head of the space station redesign has resigned for health reasons.

Shea was hospitalized shortly after his selection in February.  He returned
yesterday to lead the formal presentation to the independent White House panel.
Shea's presentation was rambling and almost inaudible.

Shea's deputy, former astronaut Bryan O'Connor, will take over the effort.

Goldin asserted that the redesign effort is on track.

They aren't going to leave a loophole as glaring as space mining.  Quite a
few of those people are, when you come right down to it, basically against
industrial civilization.  They won't stop with shutting down the mines here;
that is only a means to an end for them now.

The worst thing you can say to a true revolutionary is that his revolution
is unnecessary, that the problems can be corrected without radical change.
Telling people that paradise can be attained without the revolution is
treason of the vilest kind.

Trying to harness these people to support spaceflight is like trying to
harness a buffalo to pull your plough.  He's got plenty of muscle, all
right, but the furrow will go where he wants, not where you want.

The problem is, you can't raise adequate amounts of money that way.
The Viking Fund tried.  They did succeed, in a way, but only because
of the political impact of their fundraising.  The actual amount of
money they raised was fairly inconsequential; it would not have kept
the Viking lander going by itself.

For the first 100 - 500 (IMHO) years nobody will have to.  The colonists will

Again, the tie that binds will be much stronger for space colonists than
any immigrants that have gone before.  Even those intrepid Asian
explorers that crossed the Bering land bridge did not have to carry their

INteresting question about Galileo.

Galileo's HGA  is stuck.   

The HGA was left closed,  because galileo  had a venus flyby.

If the HGA were pointed att he sun,  near venus,  it would
cook the foci elements.

question:  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point.?

After all,  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway?

or would it be that an emergency situation i.e. spacecraft safing
and seek might have caused an HGA sun point?

Henry,

didn't the Little Joe  and Big Joe  get built in under a year?
6 months for little Joe,  and 12 Months for Big Joe?

i thought i saw something on that for  a old mercury film.

When I was at the Texas Star Party a few years ago, the sky was so dark
that Venus did, indeed, cause light pollution until it set.

Even if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem.  Imagine observing an
object and halfway through your run, your object was occulted!

I would guess that most of the people stating positive opinions are not 
fanatically serious observers.

It is so typical that the rights of the minority are extinguished by the
wants of the majority, no matter how ridiculous those wants might be.

      Ethnocentric USian that I am, I've assumed that we and the
xUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to track
non-cooperative objects in low Earth orbit. Grazing in a couple of 
databases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilities
along this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposes
for orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can 
determine orbital elements for the objects it detects). Abstracts of 
the articles are appended. 


    This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than 
the US, Russia, and Japan do space surveillance, and if so, how and 
why?

Radio Research Laboratory, Review (ISSN 0033-801X), vol. 34,
March 1988, p. 23-34. In Japanese, with abstract in English.
     This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS
(experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13,
1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an
outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <----
station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical
equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit
prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS
tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also
discussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the
position of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was
launched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <----
satellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <----
optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <----
useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <----
stages. Furthermore, the results confirm the effectivenes of these  <----
two satellite optical tracking techniques.                          <----


MU radar measurements of orbital debris

     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross 
section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-
power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data 
processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of 
orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail 
echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, 
they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----
observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----
collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an 
altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as 
once per two years. 


Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C)

Publication Date: Jun. 1986
      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere 
troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar 
features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large 
VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed 
to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier 
feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast 
beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the 
antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal 
division/combination are performed at a low signal level using 
electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna 
beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the 
zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element 
is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful 
calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna 
element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for 
this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to 
make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern 
monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific 
satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna 
Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 
watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement 
and results are discussed.

     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent 
scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 
km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in 
Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The 
system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array 
configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been 
in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about 
3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective 
antenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of 
the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam 
steering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, 
a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of 
the radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration 
is presented.

                             April 23, 1993
                              10:00 AM PDT

Flight Sequence C8 is active, the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument
payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise
configuration, with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna; uplink
at 125 bps, downlink at the 2 K Engineering data rate.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all
payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault
protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory
was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at 10:30 AM.

Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to
perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for
analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator
testing will take place on Monday .

The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with
activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due
to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.
This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements
which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require
the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state
and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points
in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.

Today, the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km (14,273,673 mi.) from Mars
travelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second (4,677 mph) with
respect to Mars.  One-way light time is approximately 10 minutes, 38
seconds.

1.  The Magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally, gathering
gravity data to plot the density variations of Venus in the
mid-latitudes.  The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees
and spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees C.

2.  An end-to-end test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout
process was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition
Experiment.  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames,
and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in
equipment at the tracking station.

3.  Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days
from the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.

4.  Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-Vernadsky
Microsymposium at Brown University in Providence, RI, this week.  This
joint meeting of U.S. and Russian Venus researchers has been
continuing for many years.

5.  A three-day simulation of Transition Experiment aerobraking
activities is planned for next week, including Orbit Trim Maneuvers
and Starcal (Star calibration) Orbits.

   {Description of "External Tank" option for SSF redesign deleted}

>and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors
>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
>seems more likely.

Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the "External Tank" and
"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign
options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports
that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have
been dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks used
in launching space shuttles," and building a "station around
an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."

Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented
to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in
today's Times).

Option "A" - Low Cost Modular Approach
This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,
there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting
the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and
Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective
teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this
option are:
  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's
     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C
     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this
     for the Air Force.
  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.
     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle
     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.
     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power
     source for 30 day missions.
  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term
     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the
     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing
     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International
     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The
     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.
     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.
  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and
     add another 20 kW of power
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,
     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return
     Vehicle).

Option "B" - Space Station Freedom Derived
The Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.
This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we
have all come to know and love :)

This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for
use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the 
number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,
for both options "A" and "B".

The build-up occurs in six phases:
  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power
     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when
     it visits.
  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist
     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is
     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by
     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes
     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the
     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).
  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,
     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal
     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.
  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,
     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the
     assembly in 24 flights.

Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, 
with the exception of the data management system, which has major
changes.

Option C - Single Core Launch Station.
This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter
cylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on
the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a 
regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket
motors, and launch the can. Some key features are:
  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout
  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels
  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against
    micrometeroid & orbital debris)
  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)
  - 7 berthing ports
  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet
    (twice the volume of skylab).
  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors
  - 10 kW of housekeeping power
  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal
    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)
  - increased crew time for utilization
  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module

Now my comments: 

I'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch 
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, 
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  

To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that 
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.

	I am puzzled by the term "concept." Drag free may already have
been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would
more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and
ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball
floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little
adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would
then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity
anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously
adjusting its position to compensate for drag.

Glad to see Griffin is spending his time on engineering rather than on

It doesn't make a whole lot of difference, actually, since they weren't
building spares of the station hardware anyway.  (Dumb.)  At least this
is only one launch to fail.

Sorry for asking a question that's not entirely based on the
technical aspects of space, but I couldn't find the
answer on the FAQs !

I'm currently in the UK, which makes seeing a Space Shuttle
launch a little difficult.....

However, I have been selected to be an exchange student
at Louisiana State Uni. from August, and I am absolutely
determined to get to see a Space Shuttle launch sometime
during the year at which I will be in America.

I hear there's a bit of a long mailing list, so if someone
can tell me how to get tickets and where to get them from, then
please E-mail me !

Thanks very much for your patience....

(And if anyone else wants to know, tell me and I'll summarize
for you - just to save all those poor people who have to
pay for their links !)

   Two developments have brought these type of activities back to
the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a
20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from
the Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,
NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner
reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-
based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV
commercial, as filmed from the Mir.
   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the
same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga
booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "Environmental
Billboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the
University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "Environmental
Billboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,
deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.
   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for
maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone reading
sensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's
delicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head of
SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,
it will release ozone-building components that will literally
replenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitor
the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns
up and "adds to the ozone supply."
   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several
millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI
estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who
watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost
$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being
promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
  
But back to Brian's questions:
>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild

    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my
estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus
$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to
tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for
optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon
someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated
launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.
    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as
well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use
of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the
legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,
and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light
pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal
challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive
aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the
advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change
positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the
space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an
idiot?)
   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low
enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would
only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before
dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just
after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time
of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still
be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)
    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There
were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga
advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for
only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding
for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking
for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I
am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.
  
   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be
my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least
I don't THINK I do...).

Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]
>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild
>idea" stage or does it have real funding?
  
    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the
Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:
  
SPACE ADVERTISING
    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very
common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the
space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the
(very prominent) logos on its side of
   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)
   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)
   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and
   - the GPS/Navstar program office
   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather
"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only
organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the
side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting
a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras
is "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my
opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has
rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]
   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials
for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large
advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of
several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at
putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload
bay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in
that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms
participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for
the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For
example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a
Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras
would scan past it.)
  
ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES
   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about
1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed
to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe
company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,
Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last
Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from
participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for
example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the
British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.
   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch
vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET
recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements
on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie "The Last
Action Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating
organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the
main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster
rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for
one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in
Space News magazine a couple of months ago.
   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is
talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he
created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising
sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the
space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on
the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use
his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and
receiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch
is a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the
advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is
coming from NASA.)
  
ORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"
   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for
some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert
Heinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several
different potential projects have been developed, although none have
been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel
II" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in
orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

I like option C of the new space station design.. 
It needs some work, but it is simple and elegant..

Its about time someone got into simple construction versus overly complex...

Basically just strap some rockets and a nose cone on the habitat and go for
it..

Might be an idea for a Moon/Mars base to.. 

Where is Captain Eugenia(sp) when you need it (reference to russian heavy

That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses
and PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be-
fore BATSE, having this widely separated "Interplanetary Network" was the
only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot
locate a burst (except to say "It's somewhere in the field of view.").  With
two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector
to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,
one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these
locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the 
sky), voila, you have an error box.

BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,
but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like
to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.

You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe
(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen
in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be
a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss
neutron star...but this is getting too far afield.

Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not
_The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't
remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola,
travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when
one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction
of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.
But the notion is not pursued further than that.

In this parable, Jesus tells the parable of the wedding feast. "The kingdom
of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son".
So the wedding clothes were customary,  and "given" to those who "chose" to
attend.  This man "refused" to wear the clothes.  The wedding clothes are
equalivant to the "clothes of righteousness".  When Jesus died for our sins,
those "clothes" were then provided.  Like that man, it is our decision to
put the clothes on.

   Here are some books I have read recently that helped me not only
   prepare for a 5 week series I taught in Sunday School, but greatly
   increased my knowledge of the Qumran scrolls. [...]

One other recent book I would heartily recommend is Joseph Fitzmyer's
_Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_ (Paulist,
1992).

Fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars.  He was also one
of the early workers on the DSS.  His book is written in a
straightforward Q&A that allows it to serve as a source for a great
wealth of clearly presented basic, up-to-the-moment information about
the DSS.

(This book is something of a companion volume to Raymond Brown's
_Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_.)

I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's
driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to 
do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.

Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion
of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do
(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.
Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually
on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking
the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say
"Crucify him" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it
again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were "invited" to sit
during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian "invitation", 
I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems
typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the
musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be
explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just
sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about
to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay
"experts", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a
bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of
bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for
people to be aware of the Lord's presence.

So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass
going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or
Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware 
of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should 
just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational
participation in Catholic Masses lately?

I'll take a try at this...

From the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted
the bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this,
before Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked 
back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know 
Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our
savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray
THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to 
Jesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses
with me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present
ourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.

Remember the OT doctrine of 2 witnesses?  Perhaps the prophets

Anything that does not bring me closer to God is a sin. 
(If you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.)

This implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should
never be satisfied. It does not imply that
having fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin.
It does imply that I sin every day.

A perhaps simpler definition:
Anything that is counter to the two Great Commandments: 
love God, love your neighbor, is a sin.
Anything I do that is not from love is a sin.

The same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.

In the discussion as to why Jesus spoke aloud the "Lazarus, come out",
I'm surprised that no one has noticed the verse immediately preceeding.

Jn 12:41  "Father, I thank you for listening to me, though I knew that
you always listen to me.  But I have said this for the sake of the
people that are standing around me that they may believe that you have
made my your messenger."  (Goodspeed translation)

My guess is that the "Lazarus, come out!" was also for the sake of the
crowd.

Well said, Michael!

The Catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the Spiritual 
Works of Mercy:

admonish the sinner
instruct the ignorant
counsel the doubtful
comfort the sorrowful
bear wrongs patiently
forgive all injury
pray for the living and the dead (yes, I know there is some controversy 
                           on this and I don't want to argue about it.)

These are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  People 
ask questions and express doubts.  Some are in need of comfort or 
prayers.  Imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs 
patiently and forgave injuries.   I would add that it is probably more 
appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly.

I can't speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to 
the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we 
unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, 
we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we 
encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with 
Christianity and reject what isn't.    

We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine 
the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch 
and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  
Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our 
lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and 
service.  The command to love God with all one's mind means no fuzzy-
headed drifting from idea to idea.

One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme 
in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions 
recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It 
too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for 
pointing out the parallel.

* The WITNESS Of The APOSTLE PAUL:  1 Corinthians 15:1-26

 1 Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to
   you, which also you received, in which also you stand,

 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I
   preached to you, unless you believed in vain.

 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,
   that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

 4 and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day
   according to the Scriptures,     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 5 and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.

 6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one
   time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;

 7 then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;

 8 and last of all, as it were to one untimely born, He appeared to me
   also.

 9 For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an
   apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did
   not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I,
   but the grace of God with me.

11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.

12 Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead,
   how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has
   been raised;

14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your
   faith also is vain.

15 Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we
   witnessed against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise,
   if in fact the dead are not raised.

16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;

17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are
   still in your sins.

18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most
   to be pitied.

20 BUT NOW CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD, the first fruits of
   those who are asleep.

21 For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection
   of the dead.

22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.

23 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those
   who are Christ's at His coming,

24 then comes the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and
   Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.

25 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.

26 The last enemy that will be abolished is death.


             LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION

            1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His
                body because that would have perpetrated the
                resurrection--the very opposite of what they
                desired.

            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His
                body because Pontius Pilate established guards
                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be
                stolen.

            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples
                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus
                had risen from the dead.

            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been
                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He
                *would indeed* rise from the dead.

            5.  The probability of being able to perpetrate such
                a hoax successfully upon the entire world for
                nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative!

Another guess to your salvation riddle would be "saved".

Sorry for taking this off of Sharon's resp, but I'd also like to add
some more verses to that and perhaps answer the second Q.

Verses:
   1 Corinthians 6:9-10
   Colossians 3:5-10

As for knowing when, that's a bit tricky.  People normally have
consciences which warn them about it.  However, as in my case, a
conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:12:13) so
that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are
sinning.  Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know
that they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining
of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and
change.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful
possibilities is:  "Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in
time?"  I know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling
question.

Oh, I missed one.  1 John 1:8-2:11,15-23.



Were the early Christians weird?  Yes!  So were their non-Christian
contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome
or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the
creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero
worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.

You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of
Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a
simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.  
Sure, it's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they
do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible
unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom-
mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries' book
_The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in 
Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?

And it won't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian
century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in
the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.

What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to
understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love
you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to
love one another, after all.  And Brown's book is, in fact, a heroic
attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and
the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too*
heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))

I don't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and
it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of
early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian)
cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious
problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory
and ironic.)

But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and
love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under-
standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin
to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other
words, MORE historical reading (Brown's other books are also good, most
especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Fox's _Christians
and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some
of Foucault's books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

Humanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person, and we killed Him.
Fortunately for us, this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy.

Easter, 1993.

(yes; this is a tad early -- our Vigil service here has been moved forward
because so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils,
and the seminarians must therefore worship-and-run if they are to do it
here and there as well.  Think of this as an Anglican fad.  :-))

I think Orthodox practice varies from place to place, from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under
 7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting. As we have to travel 70km to the church, we don'
t receive communion every Sunday, but about every third Sunday.

Much of the OT prophecies have a double application: to the Jewish

prophecies could not apply to the AD70 destructioin of Jerusalem.

  Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This
doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.

  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like
it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,
and isn't.  
  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement.
  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to
live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great
deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the 
male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.
  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great
ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings
and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  
Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism
is an attractive option.
  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)
should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.

Hi, You might want to read Charismatic Chaos by John MacArthur.  In it
he discussed exactly this queation, amongst others.  In my own words,
VERY simplified, his position is basically that one must decide, what
is the most important - experience or Scripture?  People tend to say
Scripture, without living according to that.  Their own
feeling/prophecy/etc tends to be put across without testing in the
light of Scripture.

There's a lot more than this, really worthwhile to read whether you're
Charismatic or not.

(MODERATOR: THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR AN EARLIER, MORE CLUMSILY WORDED
SUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO.)

I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of
how the word 'Easter' *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now*
mean anything to Christians other than 'the feast day of the Resurrection
of Jesus Christ'. 

The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.

And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter
may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival,
but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to
honor any kind of "pagan goddess" by celebrating Easter.

It is nonsense to say "this word (or this practice) 'really' means so-
and-so even though nobody realizes it."  Words and practices don't mean
things, people do.  

(This is basic semantics; I'm a linguist; they pay me to think about
things like this.)

John, 

While I will not take the time to rebut you point by point, I will suggest
three current works which I think will be helpful in your quest to answer
this question.  John Dominic Crossan (Professor of Religion at De Paul Univ)-
_The Cross That Spoke_ Harper and Row Pub. 1988, Also his latest work 
_The Historical Jesus - The Life of A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant_ Harper
and Row Pub. 1991,  Also two works of Burton Mack (Professor of New Testament
at the Claremont Graduate School) _A Myth of Innocence_ Fortress Press 1988,
And his latest book _The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins_
Harper and Row, 1992.  You might start with Mack's book on Q and then 
examine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will
see that your "evidence" is not as sturdy as you'd like.  Most of the tired
arguements you stated, assume eyewitness accounts, such is not the case. But
Anyway look at Mack and Crossan and then get back to us.

One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin 
of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically 
stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  
He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an 
example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.

This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals 
His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some 
degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding 
of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the 
husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  
One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband 
and to the husband through the wife.

Eric ("Damien"?) was presenting his views on Christianity; I'll
respond to a few of his points:

This is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of-
nature.  

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For
example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space
world didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it
possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely
impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of
life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent
indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
found *outside* that world, in its Source.

When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are
presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one
the requires a kind of "faith" too.   By taking such a hard line in
your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.

But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope
you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by
reading Paul Johnson's "A History of Christianity".  From your remarks,
it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
religion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and
be animated by some enduring values.

With best wishes,

On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the 
same.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people 
seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better 
when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy 
committees are trying to get our attention and make things more 
meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too. 

Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My 
local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish 
over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the 
style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to "just offer 
it up" probably is the solution.

A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is 
that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like 
innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual 
needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor 
of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty 
complicated.

One thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still 
Mass.

I am glad that I am not an atheist.  It seems tragic that some people 
choose a meaningless existence.  How terrible to go on living only 
because one fears death more than life.  I feel so sorry for Eric and 
yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as 
further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity.    

As a Christian I am free to be a human person.  I think, love, choose, 
and create.  I will live forever with God.

Christ is not a kind of drug.  Drugs are a replacement for Christ.  
Those who have an empty spot in the God-shaped hole in their hearts must 
do something to ease the pain.  This is why the most effective 
substance-abuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual 
needs.

Thank you, Eric for your post.  It has helped me to appreciate how much 
God has blessed me.  I hope that you will someday have a more joy-filled 
and abundant life.

Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of
Moody Bible Institute:

>  evangelical Christians, saying we believe in absolutes and think we
>  are the only ones who know what the absolutes are.

There has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on
exactly what the criticism of "arrogance" is aimed at.

The arrogance being attacked is that we "think we are the only ones who know
what the absolutes are".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are
infallible on the matter of religious texts.

In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can
think of epistemology as "how do you know?"  That question, it turns out, is
a very troubling one.

The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of
the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that
everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to
discover a source of truth is in question.

And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of
authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.


Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional
Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of
Papal Infallibility, too.)

Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and
several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and
possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute
Truth.

He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.
His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made
mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His
conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made
mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made
mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)

Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that
happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what
he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own
infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own
reasoning, that belief cannot be considered "absolutely certain".

Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief
is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can
say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.

Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on
your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible
thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.


This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing
epistemology: "how do you know?"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:

 A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.

 B: How do you know?

 A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church
    teachings and came to this conclusion.

 B: How do you know you studied history correctly?

 A: Well, I double-checked everything.

 B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?

 A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.

 B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is
    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?

 A: ...

And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say "I
can't prove that there are no mistakes" -- and as long as you may have made a
mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.

There is no way out of the loop.


This is where the "arrogance of Christians" arises: many people believe
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the
doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are
infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.

Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led
you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.

 *

People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to
find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking
the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),
but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is
knowably Inerrant.

Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me,
an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,
situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agree
with this definition?  I think you do:

A simple example:

In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't
provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover
their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, 
this is truth and therefore absolute.  

Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all 
scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and 
coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  
Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare 
heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew 
up in.)

Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)
Can you reconcile this?

I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are very
few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.

But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can you
determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree how
to interpret the Scripture?  

It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your own
background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the 
Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that 
you in fact interpret?

	Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced

	*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need
	not be researched; 3) religion was "made up" by humans to address a
	perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that
	is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical
	structure with biology at the apex).

	Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the
	underlying presuppositions.

	I disagree that Christianity is "an infectious cult".  It has
	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in
	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.
	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is
	"infectious" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides
	a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this
	is the case).

	I disagree that Christianity is "a safety blanket" which supplants
	hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one
	Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a
	Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to
	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose
	and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of
	control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?

	Finally, one does not appropriate "eternal happiness" by following
	Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance
	of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people
	from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the
	Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian
	in the Person of God's Spirit.

	Heaven is one of two final states that
	Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally
	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this
	promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived
	benefits to them in the here-and-now.

	Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a
	priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this
	as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate
	priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,
	convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).
	Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting
	the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits
	of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful
	that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask
	"Why?"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-
	plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it
	does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian
	is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of
	friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot
	evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or
	harm others if the sole purpose of being a "friend" is to gain a
	conversion).

	As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-
	ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a "hurry-up"
	attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no
	conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was
	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open
	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).
	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings
	conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part
	(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.

	than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is
	so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find
	a more expansive view.

	(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing

Several recent posts have identified the English word 'Easter' with
the Babylonian goddess 'Ishtar'.

'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar.
If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it.
But in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East'
and German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'.
Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'.
Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.

There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they
are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.

Tsk.tsk. Too much argument on non-issues !
I'm Roman Catholic and it seems to me that people
celebrate Easter and Christmas for itself rather
than how it relates to Jesus. I don't really
care about some diety. If people have some other
definition of Easter, then that's their business.
Don't let it interfere with my Easter.

"Resurrection Sunday" 8-) Where did that come from ?
If people celebrate Easter for the Cadburry bunny,
that's their business.

I've always been curious about this. Is Jesus important
to Jews at all ? I thought He was thought of only
as a prophet ? If that's true what do they celebrate
Easter for ?



I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged
couple become "married" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have
publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and
are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective
qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.

Suppose they are unable to get before the altar right at the current time
because of purely logistical reasons beyond their control.  What do you
think about this?

Post or e-mail me with general responses.  If you need clarification as to
what I am asking, please e-mail.

Thanks and God bless!

No the members of the first group are not necessarily
arrogant.  But when I ask them if they are absolutely certain
that the volcano will erupt, I expect them to say so "No,
but I've chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have
determined that the volcano will erupt," rather than, "Yes, I am
absolutely certain."  When it comes to religious discussions,
arrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of
statement.

I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few
years back and I can't cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who
was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded
to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave
to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the
true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to
*conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of
*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in 
which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate
to one another and to God.

IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served 
on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in 
which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker 
in federal prison.

       That argument would be more compelling if it were not for the
Ishtar eggs and Ishtar bunnies.  Why mix pagan fertility symbols from the
worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with Biblical belief?  What
would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word "Easter" and
replace all such occurances with "Resurrection Sunday"?  Would you not
show up for services if they were called "Resurrection Sunday Services"
rather than "Easter Services"?

  I'll start with a parable.
 
  A Christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse.  When he comes
over, they begin talking about religion.  "So you believe that you understand
God?" he asks.  "Yes, I do," she replies.  "Then have him build you the 
birdhouse."

  I don't think that Melinda is complaining about the basis of Christian 
belief.  However, there is a tendency among Christians to say, "I have all the 
answers because God gave them to me."  This is simply not the case.
  I believe that the Bible is inerrant.  However, our HUMAN interpretations of
the Bible are necessarily in error, because we are human and imperfect.  We
have to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith, and that because we are
human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God.  To
claim, as so many people do, that the existence of the Bible allows us to
determine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fully
understand God's will.  This is hubris.

First of all, God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing
people.  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on
whom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed
punishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus
to "seek and save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10)?

You asked for it.

2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.
Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in
God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.
2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the
disciples "will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out
from the presence of the Lord".
2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth
being condemned.
Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes
and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in
the "fiery lake of burning sulfur".
Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast
"will be tormented with burning sulfur" and there being "no rest day or
night" for them because of it.
Psalm 9:17:  "The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that
forget God."

I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.

[In the following I'm mostly playing "devil's advocate".  I'm not
advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that
it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible
to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often
uses the term "second death".  The most obvious understanding of that
would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks
both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms
that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince
you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that
there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to
understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary
point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,
whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35
implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably
they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to 
understand this passage in a non-literal way.)

2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them
in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.

Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is
eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.
Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been
prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the
eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet
will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being
thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as "the second death".
This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible
that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as
the devil, and humans?

2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is "everlasting destruction"?
This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be
understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think
that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction
that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in
eternity.

2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.
Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above
Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,
it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says
that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that 
there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people
are tormented forever.

Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.

Having met Peter Kingston (of WBT) some years back, he struck me 
as an exemplery and dedicated Christian whose main concern was with
translation of the Word of God and the welfare of the people
group he was serving.
WBT literature is concerned mainly with providing Scripture
in minority languages.

The sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this
along the lines of "ideological manipulation and cultural
interference" is probably no more than Christianising and
education - in this WBT will stand alongside the early Christian
missionaries to parts of Africa, or those groups who worked
among native Americans a couple hundred years ago.

I think you need to substantiate these attacks as being a

It is interesting that you posted those lyrics, because just the

since whenever I am approached by judgemental, pharisitical,

I have long hair, wear a black leather jacket, and listen to Black

    I am sorry you find these charges amusing, Mark. I understand your
frustration though--it can be kind of scary to find your assumptions
challenged. Some of the specific cultural interference to which I refer
includes linguistic manipulation, for instance, their Tzotzil-Spanish
dictionary removed both Spanish and Tzotzil words for concepts which are
threatening to the ruling ideology, e.g., class, conquer, exploitation,
repression, revolution, and described words which can express
ideological concepts in examples like "Boss--the boss is good. He treats

Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):

I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.

The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence
of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason
is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, "Traditional Proofs for the 
Existence of God," and Summa Theologica).

Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,
I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen
condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?

Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,
the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the
Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order
to the universe (logos).

I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is
contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,
since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior
as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because
a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source
of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.
Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.

Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim
is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.

You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United
States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent
instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will
reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,
and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For
example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could
have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must
be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. 

Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

There is a certain truth to this statement. Only I would use the word
"medicine" instead of drug.  With regard to the condition of the human
soul, Christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine.  It also
strengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new
strength and health to live and be and to do that for which God created 
us.

Christ's medicine, rightly allowed to work, brings one nearer to

Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)



for SRC

In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is
known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word
which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning "Passover." In English,
German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER,
or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the
origin of this term.

One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE
RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an
Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great
scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived
673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of
the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well
established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth
of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely
that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that
there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,
and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance
(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should
have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf
convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does
not make it more so.

Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the
Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some
centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.
It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians
and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every
spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply "Spring
Festival."

However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J
Knoblech, in "Die Sprach," ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5
(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:

Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast
of the Resurrection was known as "hebdomada alba" (white week),
since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their
white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was
referred to simply as "albae." Translaters rendering this into
German mistook it for the plural of "alba," meaning "dawn." They
accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for
"dawn." This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.

 Yours,
 James Kiefer

of celebrating Easter.  However this seems like it contains enough

Rick has nailed the problem down pretty well.

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details
when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based
on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.  

It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage:
husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before
each other and God that you will convenant together to be
married, then...you are (IMO).

So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be
there for "connectedness" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers
and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some
accountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept
from Hebrews about "not forsaking the assembling of yourselves
together as is the custom of some."  We need each other because
Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a
self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone
see the Paul Simon "I am a rock, I am an island..." model anywhere
in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?

Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA
and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go
crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to
obey them to avoid even the appearance of "evil" (I Thess 5:22)

So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage,
but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the 
conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are
married when you and your intended promise each other and God
to be in convenant. (IMO)

What ch'all think ?

[In some states, the kind of commitment described in Richard Szanto's
posting can create a common law marriage.  Indeed his posting itself
might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists,

So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since
this is the only other source of information left to us).
How can you then convince somebody that your "feelings and experiences"
are the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and
measurable effects?  If my experiences say that "there exists no god"
and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only
going on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal
realities.

Furthermore, the trouble with "feelings and experiences" is that they
can lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I
am sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but
I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.

Finally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical
sphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?

You must be using a definition of "evidence" that I am not familiar with.
To me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that
what you are saying is true.

However, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.
It is not something you can share around - others must experience it
independantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts
belief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians
do not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of
these things can go.

At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, 
the trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY
claim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best
evidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it
should read "for explaining the non-existence of God").  So not only
must you "prove" your own case, you have to "disprove" theirs.

(alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief

I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't.
I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes
without saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct
me.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the 
non-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made
some progress towards the truth.

I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental.  I think
that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they
were trying to say that headbangers would like the program.  But I would
NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc.  it is
condescending.  And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him.

By the way, Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar.

Personally, I'm a headbanger at times too, but I have a hard time with what
most of the secular metal groups promote.  Free sex and drugs (my opinion
that many promote these) aren't my thing.  I HAVE found several good
Christian metal groups that I like.

Ok, god has the disclaimer, reserves the right to judge individual
cases.  If we believe him to be loving, then we also believe him to be
able to serve justice to all.  Don't worry if a Jew, or athiest is
going to heaven or hell, for that is god to judge (although truly
if you were concerned you could only worry abput those who refuse to
believe/satisfy gods decrees) as much as keeping yourself straight.
If you see something going on that is wrong, discuss it and explore it
before making summary judgement.  People have enough free will to choose
for themselves, so don't force choices on them, just inform them
of what they're choices are.  God will take care of the rest in his justice.

OFM responds to a query about reference works:

   [Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an
   introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible
   courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary
   styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further
   reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT
   introduction...

Two other Intros to consider:

The "Introduction" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text.
The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but
the book contains a wealth of information.

Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more
modern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the
authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order
of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the
development of the NT.

   ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the
   best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.

A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is "OK" but not great.  One
particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on
bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick
look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy
in my office at work).

   ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...

So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title
(James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think
I recall a (older) series under the name "Harper Commentaries".  Also
there's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on
the HC also apply to the HBD.)

My favorite one-volume commentary is the "New Jerome Biblical
Commentary".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased
towards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether
these are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and
large excellent.

NOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the
"Jerome Biblical Commentary", copies of which can still be found on
sale.

Can the Father possibly not hear the words of His children.
Of course He hears all your prayers.
Whether you are a sinner or a saint, no questions.
The real question you should be asking is: "Does sin block OUR hearing His
answer?" And the answer to that question is a resounding YES.
To paraphrase the gospel "Many are called but few choose to listen"
and so it is with prayer. 


In Christ,

James

Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony,
nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so.

Let's distinguish _real_ logistical problems (like being stranded on a
desert island) from _excuses_ (such as waiting for so-and-so's brother
to come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony)...

It just goes to show that not all evangelical fundamentalists are pharisitical!

The basic question here is "how do I know what I am supposed to do?"
This is true in every situation that comes up. Some people do not
think about it at all and merely follow their impulses. I claim
that is just as dangerous as "following authority". I could site
sexually transmitted diseases, drug abuse, all manner of criminal
activity, the savings and loan scandal, car accidents, eggs thrown
at my house, all are examples of people not "following authority".
I could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the 
problem was a leader not following _his_ authority and doing what 
he wanted. Of course, where is the top of the chain? Therein lies 
our search.

I don't think it's as simple as you are claiming. "Pressing need" is
ambiguous. Should I recycle or not? 
 
Realize that I have four kids who, despite being very precocious 
of course, are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding
the tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them.

> Just be sure to listen when authority answers.

Ahh! An ironic ending.
 
The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper 
sticker cliche "Question Authority" was that I was questioning 
the authority of the person telling me to question authority.
It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning
only in being different, only in rebelling, forsaking everything
for the sake of freedom. I question their integrity and fortitude. 
There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly.
Different people are at different levels of development in different
areas. Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities
to follow, we can't know everything about everything. Often 
when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher,
perhaps blindly. Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate
questions should I question him, only when I have developed
my skills enough should I challenge him. Once again, how do I know
when I get to those stages?

If you have to be told to question authority, perhaps you shouldn't.

Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics,
the answer would be that the cause of war was economic. My observations
over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading
beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of
the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other
items that identify one group of men as being different from another.

If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would
put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some
individuals assume "Christlike" natures, most of us do not even
come close.

I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that
it is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems)
conflict.

Yes, in fact Peter is now at Wycliffe HQ in the U.K., and is a member of my

OFM replies to a question on the multiplicity of translations of the bible,

>As far as I know, no Christians

Unfortunately, this isn't true.  On another news group earlier this year,
someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version
of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English
translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A
few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster
advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations.
Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV.
The idea that the KJV is THE English Bible is more prevalent than many
might think.

Here are some notes about what the church is to be like and some helpful
ideas about how to choose a church:

Colossians 1:15-18
   A.  Jesus is the head of the body, the church
   B.  You cannot say "yes" to Jesus, but "no" to the church

Ephesians 2:19-22
   A.  The church is the family of God
   B.  The church is based on the Word of God only
          Cornerstone=Christ
          Foundation= Apostles=New Testament
                      Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)

1 Corinthians 12:12-13
   A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church

As for the question of denominations:
   A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians
4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13
   B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in
the church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church
(and in time, their writings)
   C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy
4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a
church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle

Hebrews 10:24-25
   A.  Do not miss church
   B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful.
Involved on a relationship level in the church
   C.  Must come to ALL services

Another verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be
encouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.

Of course, more standards apply:
   1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives
and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie,
disciples).
   Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul
(natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly
face to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take
Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify
his statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the
pastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of
other verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've
made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of
Matthew 24).

i have a question for you all related to this.  jesus condemns divorce
several times in the new testament, and i have a hard time with this.
the catholic church (as far as i can tell) does grant annulments with
the statement that the marriage never really existed in God's eyes.
(please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.)  however, i have
witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but
recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by
staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal
childhood issues that had never been resolved.  i ask you, is divorce
justified in such a case?  they knew who they were, what they were
doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out.
i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or
even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else
later on.  opinions?

[This is a commonly discussed question, though it's been long enough
that I'll allow it to be asked.  As you might expect, there is a range
of answers.  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never
justified.  (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused,
or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions
that I know.  No one should be forced to stay in a situation where
they are in danger.)  Others see it as a last resort in situations
that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is
to choose the lesser of evils.  In some sense the difficult legal
question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  That's because
of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par.  As with so many other
things, this turns on your approach to the Bible.  Conservative
Protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions.
More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where
a literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (It is noted
that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost
on a whim.  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is
that Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not
to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be
exceptions.)  Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take a
theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through
the process of anullment.  In the last discussion most of our
non-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that
in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a
feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of
helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that
come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce
should not be necessary.  --clh]



Hi,

I don't know much about Bible. Could you tell me the relations of
Christians with non-Christians in Bible? How should be The relations of
christian nations with each other and the relations of Christian nations
with other nations who are not Christians?

The other question is about the concept of religion in Bible. Does the
religion of God include and necessitate any law to be extracted from
Bible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the
government sides? If for example, any government or a nation is one of
the wrongdoings according to Bible, how should they be treated? 

Is there any statement in Bible saying that Bible is a guide for every
aspects of life?  

Thank you.

Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial
     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or
     will he assume the superstition of his parents
     when questioning? 

I've often found it to be the case that the theist
     will stick to some kind of superstition when
     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've
     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,
     and the other theists alike.  All assume that
     their mothers and fathers were right in the
     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief
     search for their god.
     
Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or
     aspects of the same religion, but overall the
     majority keep to the belief that some "Creator"
     was behind the universe's existence.  I've
     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice
     versa, I've known Christians who were once
     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known
     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout
     their transition from one faith to another,
     they've kept this belief in some form of higher
     "being."  Why?
     
It usually all has to do with how the child is
     brought up.  From the time he is born, the
     theist is brought up with the notion of the
     "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,
     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told
     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)
     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in
     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.
     He is also told that to question this (as
     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime
     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-
     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.
     Thus, by the time he is able to read the
     scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"
     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
     matter of course.
     
But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able
     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to
     inculcate the child the "right" readings of
     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant
     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to
     explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."
     Circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and
     "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of
     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath
     of some sort, and the child must learn to put
     away his brain when the matter concerns God.
     All of this has some considerable effect on the
     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the 
     superstitions he's been taught are nearly
     impossible to remove.
     
All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,
     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.
     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that
     God *does* exist and look at everything from
     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most
     theists can somewhat, especially when presented
     with "mythical gods" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,
     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption
     of God's existence and question it impartially?

The following is a survey we are conducting for a term project in a philosophy
class. It is not meant to give us anything interesting statistically; we want
to hear what kind of voices there are out there. We are not asking for full-

As I do not read these groups often, please email all responses to me at
shimpei@leland.stanford.edu. As my mail account is not infinite, if you can
delete the questions and just have numbered answers when you write back
I would really appreciate it.

Since we would like to start analyzing the result as soon as possible, we
would like to have the answers by April 30. If you absolutely cannot make
it by then, though, we would still liken to hear your answer.

If anyone is interested in our final project please send a note to that effect

If anyone is interested in our final project please send a note to that effect
(or better yet, include a note along with your survey response) and I'll try
to email it to you, probably in late May.

SURVEY:

Question 1)
Have you ever had trouble reconciling faith and reason? If so, what was the
trouble?
(For example: -Have you ever been unsure whether Creationism or Evolutionism
               holds more truth?
              -Do you practice tarot cards, palm readings, or divination that
               conflicts with your scientific knowledge of the world?
              -Does your religion require you to ignore physical realities that
               you have seen for yourself or makes logical sense to you?)
Basically, we would like to know if you ever _BELIEVED_ in something that your
_REASON_tells you is wrong.

Question 2)
If you have had conflict, how did/do you resolve the conflict?

Question 3)
If you haven't had trouble, why do you think you haven't? Is there a set of
guidelines you use for solving these problems?

Thank you very much for your time.

As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on
personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up
to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by
personality type summary file.

One observation is that people have significantly different personalities
(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect
to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while
other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more
solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if
confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of
people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.

My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and
create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted
(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am
quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches
to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very
uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly
influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.
(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both
preferences have their place in the Body).

Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words
are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert
scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is
excerpted from my summary:

1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:

        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside
                          world of people, activities or things.

        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal
                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.


Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can
structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise
the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities
to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects
of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among
their members to the detriment of all.

Since Jesus was born in the Middle East, then I expect his human
features to be similar to Middle Easterners at that point in time.
And since the camera wasn't invented yet we can only guess what 
he looked like. For example, with all the dinosaur bones we're
digging up we still don't know if they were yellow-polka-dotted,
or purplish-orange 8-). Likewise, I don't think anybody has a 
picture of Jesus (is there ? 8-) ) So our current image of 
Jesus is our best guess.

Okay. So let's assume that Jesus is black. Would that make you
follow His techings ? Cause if you follow His teachings, skin 
color becomes a moot point, anyway. What counts more in your
life ? Your faith in Jesus or His skin color (as a human) ?

In the interest of historical accuracy, however, since Jesus
was from Israel wouldn't His skin color be like any other Jew ?
i.e. fair-skinned ? Although probably heavily tanned from the
desert sun ? Experts in this area speak up !!! cause I'm not. 8-)

I'm interested if anyone out here can point me towards a review of the
following book in any scholarly Christian journal, whether it be
conservative or liberal, Protestant or Catholic.

_The_Lost_Years_of_Jesus_ (documentary evidence for Jesus' 17 year
journey to the East), by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.  Supposedly this
is a theory that was refuted in the past, and she has re-examined it.

I thought this was just another novel book, but I saw it listed as
a text for a class in religious studies here.  Also, the endorsements seem
to come from some credible sources, so I'm wondering if scholars have
reviewed it (or anyone on the net, for that matter).

If I am not mistaken, the Jewish family names Cohen, Kahn, etc.
are considered to be legitimate indicators of descent from Aaron.
The family names Levi, Levene, etc. are considered to be legitimate
indicators of descent from Levi. The main legal issue is the purification
of the priesthood, which is supposed to involve finding the ashes of
of the red heifer last used for this purpose 2000 years ago.

This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this 
doctrine:


                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD


I.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD
     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most
     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. 
     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should
     be to know God.
     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three
     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the
     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I
     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in
     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each
     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also
     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.
     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.

II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.
     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for
         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and
         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without
         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.
     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.
     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.
         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,
         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;
         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.
     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely
         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of
         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.
         6:3.
     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time
         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all
         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,
         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with
         unlimited power over all creation).
         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It
         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day
         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our
         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the
         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the
         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign
         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives
         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes
         regarding salvation.

III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.
     A.  In creation
          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in
          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining
          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs
          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end
          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;
          Heb. 1:3.
     B.  In salvation
         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is
         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. 
         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,
         active in salvation.
         1.  God, the Father
             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the
             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would
             be salvation, the conditions under which people
             could and would be saved, and even who would be
             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in
             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph
             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.
         2.  Christ, the Son of God
             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the
             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two
             important works:
             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of
                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.
             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the
                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on
                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by
                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The
                  work of salvation will be completed for us when
                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-
                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.
         3.  The Holy Spirit
             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is
             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is
             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the
             following ways:
             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11
             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new
                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.
             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work
                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.
             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making 
                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.
             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of
                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13
             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of
                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.
             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of 
                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12
             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.
             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  
                  Cf. Acts 1:8

>4. Who exactly is "The Lord"?  "God" or Jesus Christ?

John 1:1 says (NKJV - the little green gideon someone forced on me one day)
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was 
God."  The Word refers to Jesus Christ so from this John declares that God
and Jesus are one.  Therefore, "The Lord" refers to both.  Also, David in the
Psalms refers to both God in heaven and the coming messiah as his Lord.  Once
again this refers to God and Jesus.

>5. What is the definition of a "Truly religious" person? Should he/she not 
   swear/curse?  Does it say anything about this in the bible?

Some of the most "truly religious" people I've known have not been Christians
and some of the greatest Christians I've known have been truly irreligious.
However, to answer your question:
The bible speaks of this in many places, A previous post to James is a good
one.  Another is Psalm 15:
"Lord, who may abide in your tabernacle?  Who may dwell in your holy hill?  He
who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart
He who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor
does he take up a reproach against his friend; I whose eyes a vile person is
despised, but he honors those who fear the Lord; he who swears to his own hurt
and does not change; He who does not put out money at usury, nor does he take
a bribe aginst the innocent.  He who does these things shall never be moved."

I appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  One reply, which
I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one 
of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's
_America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles 
Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT 
translation in the New American Bible.  He noted "...certain practices have 
been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, 
and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy."  I note that at my 
parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the 
offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen".  This was not a 
kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.

I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a
whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation
on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).
Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is
the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems
so...Christian?

Hello, I'm back..

I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be
it a positive or negative one). I read EVERY letter and thought about 
each one!! 

I got all sorts of responses, from "marry her" to "have nothing ever to 
do with her again"

Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have
decided to do.

I sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious
about moving away from home to another state that "I would do anything to 
get you here in NC." I told her that I tried to find out if there were 
any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.

About her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause
I still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said
that "Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)"

Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.

Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I 
have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If
she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it
yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian.
It just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure
that if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10 
years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it
will happen!

She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to 
see her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know
more of what to look forward to.

I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell
my folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.

I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation
in your prayers..

Finally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...

If you have anything else for me...I will be at this email address
for one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curious
how folks think about what i did.


Thanx

Chris



Are the Serbs doing the work of God?  Hmm...

I've been wondering if anyone would ever ask the question,

Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving
to end the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs because the targets are
muslims?

Can/Does God use those who are not following him to accomplish
tasks for him?  Esp those tasks that are punative?

It is funny how this one little quote from Genesis is treated
by certain anti-Christians as if Christians have been given a
firm command to destroy the earth. You could prove almost
anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible
- it's a big book, you know. I doubt you could find a single
case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically
because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief.

As for the Nazis, they were motivated by German Nationalism,
not by Christianity. In fact they despised Christianity as a
weak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan
glorification of strength and warfare. They killed the Jews
because they were not Germans, not because they were
"Christ-killers" - they were just as keen on killing the other
non-German ethnic minority, the Romanies or Gypsies.

Let me carry that a step further.  Most doctors would not claim to be 
infallible.  Indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably
be wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to 
be necessary after all.  However, the doctors would have enough confidence
and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.  As
fallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are
wrong.  However, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable,
and stand by their convictions.

 There was an article on clari.news.religion in the last few days about a
Polish tribunal decision. It said that crucifixes and religious classes in
public schools were okay; and that children who did not want to take religion
class could not be forced to take an ethics class as a substitute.

I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians
suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:

ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had
            them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of
            Jesus, and let them go.

ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been
            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.

It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion
to even hearing Jesus's name.
ACT 5:28    "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said.
            "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are
            determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."

Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly
not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen. 


>The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different
>forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection

The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one
must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He
stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would
have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those
that had plotted to kill Him.

        My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas
carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and
heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either -
I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.
        Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how
religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though
I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -
just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't
definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by
religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to
understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.

        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is
correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian
God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about
people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -
agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their
beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between
the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do
you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow
a different religion than you would if they were Christian??

        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in
the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be
stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??

        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are
fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and
'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find
hard is the actual belief in God.

        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite
believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not
believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why
I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.

        Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came
into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

                        Thanks for the help,

Joe;

Your logic excapes me. 

If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the 
Pope cannot "be wrong!"  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter 
of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the
Pope is the legal head of the church.

In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice
but to obey.

[You might want to look at the FAQ on infallibility.  The doctrine on
infallibility does not say that the pope is always right.  All
Catholic theologians acknowledge that there have been a number of
occasions when the pope was wrong.  There appear to be two aspects to
infallibility.  One is a general concept that in the long run the
Church is protected from serious error.  However this does not mean
that it's impossible for it to take wrong turns at one time or
another.  The more specific concept of papal infallibility is that in
very specific circumstances a papal statement can be known to be
infallible.  However a relatively small fraction of statements meet
those criteria.  This does not absolve Catholics from the duty to obey
even "ordinary" teachings of the pope.  However only a few teachings
are made in a way that is explicitly infallible.  --clh]

 I find this view of Christianity to be quite disheartening and sad.
The idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a Creator
does not seem like much of a basis for belief.

 And the logic is also appalling: "God must exist because I want Him to."

 I have heard this line of "reasoning" before and wonder how prevalent
it is. Certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is
hopeless (or so the pollsters and newscasts state), but I don't see
where this is a good reason to become religious. If you want 'meaning'
why not just join a cult, such as in Waco? The leaders will give you
the security blanket you desire.

Oh, but they definitely can be.  Please look at Colossians 3:5-10 and

Timothy so much about making sure to teach self-control?

Please, re-think and re-read for yourself, Joe.  Again, the issue is
self-control especially over feelings and actions, for our actions stem
from our feelings in many instances.  As for God giving in to his anger,

I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style "values-free" methods, that
teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make "choices",
actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while
back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The
article included sources to contact for information on research verifying
these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring
abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.

The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula
were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is
reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy
rate.

The difference is not in "contraceptive technology" but in the values taught
to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have
legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that
they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the
values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of
these kids.

Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are
suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that
desired.  

Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't
we teach "safe drug use" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it
because we know that a class in "how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to
use drugs" would increase drug use?  Why isn't "drug abstinence education"
barred from schools because it teaches "religion"?  Aren't we abandoning
those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe
use?

In 12-step programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous), one of the steps
involves acknowleding a "higher power".  AA and other 12-step abuse-
recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.

Unfortunately, as evidence for God, this can be dismissed by stating
that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes 
people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that
being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but
still maintain that both are escapism.  (And I suspect that there
are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to
Christianity.)

I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ-
ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves
as incomplete, and needing God (the 'God-shaped hole'), while atheists
necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are
right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly
to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists
are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (I use the term atheist to
refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God,
as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about God.)

I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, 
I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of 
etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my 
childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. 

I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very 
angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It 
carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some 
time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and 
`Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To 
become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would 
consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared 
to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a 
better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable 
riches of knowing Christ.

As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that 
they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time 
they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They 
didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  
For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   
When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her 
death, she said to me, "As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew." 
What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a 
Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with 
matzoh balls.:-)) 

I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My 
sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who 
do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people 
Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.

This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their 
experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while 
following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  

I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  
It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have 
a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small 
sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it 
and do not want to ask for it back.

And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  
I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the 
Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is 
that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, 
being rooted in the past. 

This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess 
around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of 
Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.

I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all 
believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish 
Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron.

I totally agree with that sentiment.  But why do you have to go further
and advocate violating what God has set up?  That is the question which
you have not answered from Scripture.  You can worship on every day, as
long as you work.  But God says the Sabbath is all mine.

Good heavens, you mean my good friend Wes Collins, who took his wife and two 
small children into the jungles of Guatemala, despite dangers from primitive 
conditions and armed guerillas, so that the indigenous people groups their 
could have the Bible in their native languages--the young man who led Bible 
studies in our church, who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding 
faith in the Lord of Love--you mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic *SPY* 
whose _real_ reason for going was to exploit and oppress the ignorant and 
unsuspecting masses?  Imagine my surprise!  I never would have thought it of 
him.

How was this terrible deceit discovered?  What exactly was the "cultural 
interference" they were caught committing?  Attempting to persuade the locals 
that their ancestral gods were false gods, and their sacrifices (including 
human sacrifices in some cases) were vain?  Destroying traditional lifestyles 
by introducing steel tools, medical vaccines, and durable clothes?  Oh and by 
the way, who did the denouncing?

I am terribly shocked to hear that my friend Wes, who seemed so nice, was 
really such a deceitful tool of the devil.  Please provide me with specific 
documentation on this charge.  There is some risk that I may not believe it 
otherwise.

 [More stuff deleted]

This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs
are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the
world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have
experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the
studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what
I have experienced.

Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my
experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of
that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things
that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my
beliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  That
doesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  Maybe
I will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of my
beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.

If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what.
Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out
of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different
explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the
underlying experiences are similar.

Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one
form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and
inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an
outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a
mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence
available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can
based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my
understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than
my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover
something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

Well, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will
somehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what
most atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness,
being contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies.

I fear the pain that often comes with the process of dying, but since I

This is something I've always found confusing.  If all your nerve endings

Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for
straying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:

> ... Moreover the Buddha says that we are 
> intrinsically good (as against Christ's "we are all sinners").

I never thought of these two ideas being "against" each other.
People might quibble about what "intrinsically" means but the
reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we
are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,
but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a 
different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do
not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking 
on water until a little doubt crept in.

Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm "what is man that you [God] 
should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower 
than the angels"?

I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David
was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath
was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.

Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what
he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.
I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that
his whole life, probably anticipating an "attaboy" from the 
Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything
and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say
how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.
Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.

Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid
getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing
adultery, we can control our own desires. 

I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other
people see this.

(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)

Your point about how "hard" other religions are is a good one, just 
as your "Parting Question" is a tough question. I think that Muslims
worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name "submission".
Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that "God" is impersonal. 
Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little
more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater 
to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but
you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more
I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my
conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's
conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology
then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

Are there any former (or present) "Eastern Religion" members here 
who could comment?

You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be
contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction
and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?
What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that
Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?
This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically
stood by the Pope.

It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is
disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over
authority and discipline.  

My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:

  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms
  could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that
  the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX
  don't jointly make such  choice.)

If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.
If I adopt the view that "I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and
there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours", that
I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.

The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction
viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical
Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines 
regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of
the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into
the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that
a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games
like "He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does
is effective...".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.

We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the "real"
traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter
East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.

I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow
error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`
I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)

What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement
regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how
do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?
Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.
Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,
one way or the other.

It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the
Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.

One could argue that they are establishing a non-geographic jurisdiction.
I don't know if that's even a concept or problem in Catholic circles.

Koresh did originally claim to be the Christ, but then backed off and
said he was a prophet.  The latest news at 8:00 CDT from Waco is that
the feds broke through a wall of the compound with a tank.  No news
besides that at this time.

Well, it's that time of year again here at IU:  graduation.
Unfortunately, this means that I am out of here, more than likely for
good.  I cannot say if I'll be in here under another username or not, or
even if I'll ever get back in here at all.  I am leaving this part of my
ministry to another brother, John Right.  So, have fun and remember that
flaming can be considered slander.

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man
occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual
world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through
history.  The Greek, for example, could say, "better a beggar in the land
of the living than a king in the land of the dead." (Iliad, I think).

The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is
an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam
or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their
sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile
humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to
him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom
Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.

It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The
relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely
extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine
an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the
spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.

It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous
were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness
that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with
the sense world.

It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient
people's ideas of life after death.

Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at "the turning point of
time" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and
we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new
revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new
vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains
something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and
much more as well.

(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf
Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my
views on this subject).

The way you refer to it as "doctrine" puts a modern intellectual coloring
on it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually
concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or
teachings today can be received.

I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to
simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed
on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception
and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of
expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately
after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In
any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,
but by contemplating the principles themselves.

On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity
that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the
human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is
created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas
dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does
today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same
time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our
eternal spiritual being had grown dim.

>maybe at sometime in the future-  

Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal
irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in
which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a
single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the
reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in
terms that did not try to spell it out.

Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to 
bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to 
soc.religion.christian.

[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about
the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification
up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]

There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the
mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the "Annunciation" by
Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28

 And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
 a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a
 man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's
 name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _"Hail,
 thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed
 art thou among women."_

Now, now, hold that line of thought - "the Lord is with Mary &
blessed art thou among women" - while you read on....

In the book, "First Lady of the World, A Popular History of
Devotion to Mary" by Peter Lappin:

The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated
than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible
that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title "The Conception
of Saint Anne", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of
a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,
just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in
emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle
of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary
is the incorruptible timber "out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_
of Christ's sinless body"; she is "God's Eden, in whom there is
no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms."  Her perfect
beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her
purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,
she was hailed as "innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,
spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from
among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve".
...
At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,
John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a 
greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all
sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.
...

Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.
From "Pocket Catholic Cathechism" by John A. Hardon:

Baptism -
Concupiscence Remains after Baptism.
Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized
but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to
injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of
Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).

Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:
In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first
parents were originally gifted three times over:
-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the
 power to think and to choose freely.
-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality
 and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.
-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,
 the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding
 title to enter heaven.
By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and
preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without
losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose
freely.

Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's
sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts
but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our
bodies on the last day...

Going back to _Immaculate Conception_
(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other
books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):

Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a
non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born 
AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but
STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:
"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.
Blessed art thou amongst women".

Even Mary was confused about this greeting.

Mary could very well have possessed all of the
_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first
parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):
    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)
    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)
    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would
                definitely want to be with those He
                has made _blessed_)
    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)

At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace
and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body
of Christ and so,

Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still
has maintained her Immaculate Heart. 

-Marida
(P.S.  I do hope that others will continue more
       light and facts on this matter.  Thanks.)

The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not
mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds.
There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I
did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over
another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not
preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in
this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.

I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view
of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that
befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater
law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the
ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of
Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that
was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the
flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental
concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized
and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus
Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.
Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the
continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).
More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,
the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate
resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.

There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the
tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.
Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma
or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a
new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not
refute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of
course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only
one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man
himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his
parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at
all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of
Christ's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.

There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John
the Baptist,

   "If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come."

This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching
either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to
the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did
not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it ("If
you care to accept it").  So I took care to point out, not that the
Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and
that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes
understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I
pointedly used "repeated earth lives" to distinguish a little from the
oriental doctrines usually associated with the word "reincarnation".
The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too
that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely
free from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, the most important expression of it being Lessing's "The
Education of the Human Race".

To return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and
Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.
And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the
incarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus
Christ, in my view.

Greetings and Salutations!

I would like to get in touch with people who
(a) consider themselves Christians (you define it), and
(b) are in the Martial Arts

Some topics for discussion:
	- your particular martial art
	- your view of the relationship between
		Christianity and your art
	- your view of the relationship between
		*your* Christianity and your art
	- why should a Christian participate in MA
	- why shouldn't a Christian participate in MA
	- Biblical views of MA; pro or con.

For example, I heard from one fellow:
	"...I tried the Karate for Christ thing and it wasn't for me..."
	- why or why not?

As an aside, I am involved (in *NO* official way) with an
organization called the Christian Black Belt Association and
I would also like to distribute info regarding upcoming events
to *those who are interested*.  No, you won't be put on any
"mailing list" nor will your name be "sold".

However, if you ARE intested in an email list, let me know.

I am interested in email replies ONLY as this is cross-posted 
to groups I don't normally read.  If anyone wants a summary
or, of course, on-going discussion, then let me know.


Shalom,

Did this happen to Jesus? I don't think so, not from what I heard. He lived
ONE DAY of suffering and died. If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then
JESUS DIDN'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?

I'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through, but I seriously
want a reasonable explanation for this.

   Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she
   could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin
   and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?
   Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite
   it's basically patriarchical structure?

She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin,
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.

She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God,
and everything that flows from that relationship.

The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in the
early Church use this particular figure a lot.)

Eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense.  Mary is the
mother of all the living in the order of grace.  As sin came through
Eve, so Grace -- Jesus Christ -- came through Mary.



mserv@mozart.cc.iup.edu (Mail Server) writes:
| One thing I don't understand is why being sacred should make the
| temple rituals secret.

The "so sacred it's secret" explanation is a bit misleading.  While
there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no
injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But
since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather
keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.

But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants
explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the
ceremony itself.

| Granted, the Gnostic "Christians"
| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely
| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.

There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.
One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was
written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret
information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that
those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve
(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).

Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and
bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He
claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the
apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which
we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,
op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*
gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.

Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize
secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching
certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a
dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is "You seem
to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you
both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not
permitted to me now to disclose these things to you" (_Clementine
Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_
it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but
can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.

Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I
don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I
believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of
early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.

| Neither New Testament
| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.

But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect
to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of
Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on
temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in
temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that
worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*
practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such
descriptions proves they did not exist?

Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from
which I have taken a few:

1. "It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
heaven, but to them it is not given" (Matt. 13:11).

2. "All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given"
(Matt. 19:11).

3. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now" (John 16:12).

4. "The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,
but I shall shew you plainly of the Father" (John 16:25).

5. "... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"
(1 Cor. 3:1-2).

6. "Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...
come unto you and speak face to face" (2 Jn. 1:12).

(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)

Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe
they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught
were actually taught openly.

| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire
| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)

Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple
endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.
There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not
change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had
ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his
time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific
connection has yet been established.

My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite
transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe
that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As
our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the
recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who
charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have
adequate knowledge of the rites in question.

i agree -- if you are going to find out anything from people who don't

well, you do believe in something, as i see it, even if it is a sort
of "anti-belief" (no negative connotation meant; i mean simply that
you believe that God _does not_ exist).  christians can also feel that
sense of "difference", however, when they are associated with "those

the cliched sound of this, everyone has to deal with his/ her
differences from other people.  i can understand how being an atheist

you should not have to repress how you feel -- you should be able to
discuss it without fear.  i think there are admirable things to learn
from any belief, which can enrich your own -- by asking myself the
questions that atheists may ask me, i can learn the answers and become
stronger in my faith.  if my faith can't support knowing the answers
to those questions, it is weak and untrue.

in some way the pressures were different, of course, because you
"chose" your beliefs -- or are you saying that they were not your
choice, but born of necessity?  [please, no flames about whether or
not gay people "choose" their lifestyle -- that's elsewhere in this

ouch, yes.  part of being a christian is accepting _everyone_ with an
open heart -- including people of "our own camp" with whom we
completely disagree.  by the same token, i believe that accusation and
suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith,
nor is it effective to try to browbeat people into accepting our
religion.  i have a different idea of mission: be what i am, a
christian who is happy in her faith, and if others see that and want
to know about either the happiness or the religion, i'll share what i
know without pressure and let them make their own decisions.  at some
point you just have to agree to disagree -- acceptance of diversity,
not uniformity, is the way to sow peace....

i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a
couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too.  as far as
i could tell, although that story was never specifically _told_ in the
bible, many references are made to it, primarily in the new testament.
in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of
satan as a (excuse the pun) "devil's advocate" for yahweh.  see the
book of job.  getting back to the fallen angel story, there are _no_
references to "lucifer" in the bible except for a mistranslation of
"the morning star" in the king james version (isaiah 14:12), which
probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as "the
sun king" referred to louis xiv.  

all in all, i don't know where the story _came from_; it may have been
rolling around for a long time, or milton (_paradise lost_) may have
invented it.  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this, but i am
in a hurry and need to eat lunch!  feel free to email me about the
other stuff i found out....  (although a lot of it is just the result
of a bible concordance program called "quickverse" -- it's really

Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most
accurate translation?



Somewhere, someone told me that Satan was the angel in charge of
music in heaven, and on top of that, he was the most beautiful
of the angels.  Isn't it funny that these days how MTV has become
the "bible" of music and beauty these days.  MTV controls what bands
are popular, no matter how bad they are.  In fact, it is better to
be politically correct - like U2, Madonna - than to have any
musical talent.  Then of course, you have this television station
that tells us all how to dress.  Think about it, who started the
retro-fashion craze??  MTV and Madonna.  Gag.

Anyway, just food for thought.  It is really my own wierd theory.

If Revelation was to come true today, I think MTV would the "ever
changing waters" (music and fashion world) that the beast would
arise from, and Madonna will be the whore of Babylon, riding the
beast and drinking the blood of the martyrs.

Hmmmm....great idea for a book/movie.....

Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire
lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The
main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by
the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been
excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city
of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of
Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter
of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto
the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle
should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of
Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks
had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the
Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd
Crusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they
considered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for the
cause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish
hordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some
hordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of
Europe (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)

Because there are about 40 homicides total (i.e. using guns, knives,
tire-irons, baseball bats, bare hands, etc...) in Switzerland
each year and 850 homicides, total, in England. That's three
times worse per capita in England than in Switzerland. Since
dead is dead, it really doesn't matter that 60% of the Switz
murders involved a gun or that only 0.9% of the English murderers
do.

Two questions:

1)  You asserted that both the AR-15 and AK-47 are not suitable for
   "real hunting".  If you have no problem with hunting, or using
   self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this?  If not

I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy
wonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for  the
Gun War on the Constitution.  Look at what the Bush administration did to
get material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of
crack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghetto
and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been
dealt onb the White House Lawn.
And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any
moral qualms about the raid...
The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of
their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_
successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will
filter this so that the general public will think the BD's
are bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with your

	No, you merely have to start working on yellowcake or else
devise a system to get it from other sources.  BTW: the DOE handles
reactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies these
reactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen has

	So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics

is yes.  So, do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can
see where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?

	Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have
been lead to believe.  BTW: 98% U235 is far better for home-made bombs
than trying to use plutonium.  The laws of physics make the creation of
a device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.

Excuse me, but if you really new what the show was about, you'd know that he
doesn't just say vagina and penis and that is how he get's his ratings. He
also addresss real issues as well as being outrageous. I don't hear any of these
other idiots doing a funny show and getting into some serious topics at the
same time, he get's people to think and entertains them at the same time, 
so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are
WRONG, and by the way, if he is such a flash in the pan, why do his ratings sustain
so well? Hmm?

And I'm sure that is a great comfort to the widows and children of
those stabbed, beaten and burned to death. The real question is,
"Did the crime rate in England go down, after they enacted 
gun control laws?" If you look at the rates before and after their

Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation
for a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern,
found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.

Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they
just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika.

Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and
counter-clockwise swastikas.

Ob guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle. 
They remember being "relocated" by the US Army, and don't intend to
do it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for
weapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better
from strangers.

Proper counter to this claim:  "Forensic analysis of the WTC bomb by

of NYT editorials by means of taggants -- the difficulty in both cases
being to have persuaded the bull to consume the taggants before

Define "armed better". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the
Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which
faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other
guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson
in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to
3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops
like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something
often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).

A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.

- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
  the trigger again.
- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,
  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.
- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
  to rotate to the next round.
- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the
  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an
  easy motion, even one handed.
- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.

- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell
  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often
  lost as you realize "hey, it's jammed!" before starting to do anything
  about clearing it.
- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the 
  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider
  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed
  of employment as a revolver.
- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of
  operation of many of them requires more training.

Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having
accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks
require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a VCR.

Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter
and pay attention. I do not seek here to say "semi-autos are junk"
merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop
with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
equipped for anything short of a riot.

Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a 
wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.
Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.
I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit
what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously
wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those
extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in
criminal encounters is less than 5.

What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple
.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police 
prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....

ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they 
        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking
        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.

       Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and

       Your assumption is that this "low" dollar/pound area is
sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what
do you base this?  

       And given that smuggling channels are already established,
and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly
more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering
doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than
drugs?

       Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define "local."  It's

       Wow, you gotta love the speculation.

       As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw
ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and
out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even
have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  

       I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be
worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed
to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of
every ship which came through.

       It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how
much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood
of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.

However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about
anything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for
carry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,
who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun
police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).

Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to-
100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable
automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto
handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.

I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make
on the order of at least $40K/year. 

Your presumption of "disadvantage" I think is not borne out by the
experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out
on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.

I've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers
carried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others
have seen Browning Hi-Powers...

This is not borne out of reality; the old Soviet Union had a very
serious domestic handgun and submachinegun trade, guns that were
of commercial grade because they were produced in honest-to-goodness
machineshops. Why would all production have to be local; don't we
have a road system that is the envy of the world?

I seem to recall incidents in the past where Chinese entreprenaurs
attempted to smuggle AK-47s (semi-autos) into this country to
get around import number limitations (May have been Gunweek where
I read that years ago...)

Any person with high-school drafting skills and vocational school
machineshop training could produce a submachinegun. You talk about
the average person not being able get even a zip-gun; well now, think
of all that private CNC controlled machinery that is not being used for
3 shifts a day; do you think that if guns were being sold on the
black market for say, $150, an enterprising mechanical engineer
could be using that machinery to produce workable submachineguns
for sale? After all, GUNWEEK had an article and pictures on how BATF
was looking for the manufacturer of quite efficient silencers that
were of commercial quality and finish.

Look at it this way, 25% of the U.S. households have a handgun. Say
at least half of those keep one for self-defense. You are talking a
potential market of of tens of millions of people who would seek
firearms for the purpose of self-preservation. Only a fool would
believe that market would not be filled, regardless of government
prohibitions.

Well, I didn't bother writing to Boxer, Feinstein or Eshoo, the terrible

Also, you need to consider our legal system.  Since any of these things
CAN be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied 
lethal force when you DIDN'T think it was necessary.  (If you thought lethal
force was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?) Ouch.  
If you are justified in shooting them at all, you are justified in using 
the best self defense ammunition you can get your hands on.  It might actually
IMPROVE the legal outcome.

This is why hollow points hold up in court.  They are safer for you, safer
for innocent by standers, (don't as a rule go through the perp) and actually
safer for the perp.  If you are using military hard ball, you may have to 
shoot him 'MANY' times, where one or two hollow points might stop him and 
do the job.  As a rule, the fewer wound channels, the better the chance 
for his surviving the incident.

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and 
one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent 
assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems
like heart attack and stroke.

'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans
using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some
may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in 
using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.
(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, 
but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage
if anything is low.)

At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred 
to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group 
can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might 
support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.

Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half
of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.

Please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  Then you might 
convince your local police departments to switch.  Good luck.

   There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.
   Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely
   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if
   it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences
   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see
   them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,
   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15
   from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

Now, unless you have an agenda against private ownership of firearms, why would
you want to harass the person trying to legally defend themselves or exercise 
their rights? (I know, defending oneself/family/whoever IS a right... at least
as far as my 9mm and I are concerned... ) (Also as far as the State of Alabama
seems to be concerned)  Why don't you push for stricter prosecution of those
who use firearms in the commission of a crime?  I've already pointed out how
we aren't nailing DUI's hard enough...  Comparing the US with other countries
seldom works, but the European attitude towards alchohol and DUI seems to work..
Their attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've
historically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive,
while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the
European monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite
language though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and
then convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain..
But first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to 
restrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while
they forced us to pay for their wars.  Of course, most American history classes
these days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to 
convey... I'm glad my Amer. Hist. teacher was a Libertarian who had us review
a good portion of the Federalist Papers, and debate their origins and meanings.

I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for
Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as
long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).

Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew
served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something
both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some
other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time
LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind
the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle
or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And "snipers"
too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.

I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but
the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that
pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels
it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even
violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally
out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war
on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,
government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites
who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the
need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military
boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced
that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances
redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that
will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been
unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse
to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.
Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a
government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply
squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances
in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too
inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them
in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...

And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things
so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are
than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't
PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...

Unbelievable.

And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,
that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun
into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many
explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000
pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,
and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources
of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as
gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,
and could be explained by "musta been a gas leak... ".  I think it could be
done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is
not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning
and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible
to cover up.

Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.
After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided
that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant
posting.

*** file follows *** 

Hi Folks;

As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it
kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the
Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.

Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other
legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things
start today.

More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen
Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the
courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, "Who stands
trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)
Weaver?"  On the evening news she said, "I am here protesting
because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
I thought we all did."  Nice sound bite (grin)!

The news reporter also interviewed some guy named "Tim"
who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the
guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he
expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.
"Tim" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver
and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop
telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know
the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law
against political activity within X feet of a courthouse
or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).

Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed
an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam
FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.

Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to
leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case
any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence
came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.

More stuff as it comes available.

500,000 to 1,000,000 self-defense incidents a YEAR doesn't count with you?

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley
in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted 
as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't
consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though
the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the "gun owner" column.

Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The "average threat
level" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well
known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because 
they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to
Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the 
"average threat level in the country" means to a resident there.

Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors 
on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once
told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the
original text, but the story started with one resident calling the 
cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a 
drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time,
unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting
an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.

Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane,
your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell
anything.

Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.  
That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches 
on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue
cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if --
DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of
these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.

You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your
government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar,
blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the
power to enforce your "rights" but you.  Unless you've given up that 
power.

Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to
believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun 
ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T 
any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to
try to raise their consciousness.

> 	Argue away ... you can't win. 

I think we can.

HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a "One 
Million Strong!" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.  
My understanding is that they "reached" it by the stratagem of including
wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak
authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they
started running a "Two Million Strong!" campaign for a while -- but they
let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they
simply were never going to reach that level of membership.

In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting
point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  
By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had 
about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the
third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).
And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical
figures from Kukla's "Gun Control," pp. 61 and 420.)

As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused
by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against 
hard-core gun banners.

I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members.
I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.

Yes, I think we can and will win this one.

I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but,
like you, I can't give any citation showing that this utilization is
CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level.  If you can, 
I'm waiting.

Proof by assertion!  I love it!  Uh, please explain why the smugglers
do not also rank a notch below (or above) the military in terms
of communications, intelligence gathering (e.g., why fight officials
when you can bribe them..."I'll give you a hundred grand to let that

What's the point here?  You're arguing that the black market
WORKS (which it does, of course).

This is the wrong way to quantify things.  The smuggler would
be concerned about value/cubic foot.  Go to a gun show and
price out a crate of good quality handguns.

What is a worthwhile firearm?  Hell, anything that WORKS!  Go
get yourself a copy of the Army's 1969 Improvised Munitions Manual.
See how easy it is to make a functional firearm.

If paying $10 for inconspicuous parts at the local K-Mart is
"through the nose."

I'd like to point out that I was in error - "Terminator" began posting only 
six months before he purchased his first firearm, according to private email
from him.

I can't produce an archived posting of his earlier than January 1992,
and he purchased his first firearm in March 1992.

I guess it only seemed like years.

That depends only on the profit of doing so.  The differences
in cost of production will determine local vs smuggle.

Those of us who have actually made semi-autos (full-autos are easier)
are getting quite a giggle out of this.  I'd estimate that 5% of
the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the
few who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical
work would probably say that 1% is more like it.

Starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that
"enough" people will be motivated.

How much is "through the nose"?  After all, we know quite a bit
about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed
by the price demanded by the "bad" part of that 90%....

The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The "profit" of
gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals
out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.
That analysis ignored some "improvements" in the criminal gun
market that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficiently
used now, but a "loaner" set up would drive the value still higher
without affecting criminal use.)

I HATE long postings, but this turned out to be rather lengthy....


Overall Crime rate:
It fell....just like that...

Acquiring weapons in Norway:
You can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a 
permit, and a good reason to get the permit....
If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from 
the police and to be a member of a gun-club.
The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or
records of SERIOUS mental diseases.
Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun
-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.
It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):
Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'
for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short 
time befor the crime.

Use of knives:
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.
You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open
in public -rigth ??

Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':
We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide
to take action we DO.
Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....
(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)

Individual vs masses:
Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some
extent....
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others ??


The issue:
I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.
We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....
IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.
But should it have to be like that ??
Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??
If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns ??

Disclaim-her:
I'm not a pacifist or anti gun. 
I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as
neccities or toys.
I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't
want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....

	At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame
war, I must disagree.
	
	There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often
chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does
basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the
fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less
training time required. 

	Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht
they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which
if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun
from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and
would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various 
gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little
test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked
people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and
shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times
were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or
the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.

	You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger
which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing
city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..

	Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but
such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I
know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off
chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that
'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time
to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.

	Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks
in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,
it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the
operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I
don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.

	As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree
100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.

ACLU Official Policies.

Policy 18, for example, opposes rating systems for motion
pictures: "Industry sponsored ratings systems create the
potential for constraining the creative process and thus
contracting the marketplace of ideas. Despite the stated goal of
providing guidance to parents, experience has shown that ratings
inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of
expression."

In regards to the Pledge of Allegiance, the ACLU states in its
Policy 84: "The insertion of the words `under God' into the
Pledge of Allegiance is a violation of the constitutional
principle of separation of Church and State."

Policy 120 states that, "Military conscription under any
circumstances is a violation of civil liberties and
constitutional guarantees." The ACLU objects to the draft even
during wartime because of the "anti-democratic power it gives
government to wage war without support of the people."

Policy 125 states, "The ACLU calls for a broad-based inquiry into
war crimes within the widest possible definition of war crimes
against humanity, and crimes against the peace, focusing upon the
actions of the United States military and other combatants
against the people of South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam."

Policy 133 states, "The ACLU recognizes that US government
reliance upon nuclear weaponry as a dominant element of foreign
and domestic policy, while propounded as a defense of democracy,
is in fact a great threat to civil liberties. Four decades of
adherence to this policy has fundamentally altered the nature of
our constitutional democratic process and poses a paramount
threat to our civil liberties."

Policy 217 objects to roadblocks "where drivers are stopped for
sobriety tests" because they "violate Fourth Amendment
principles." 

Policy 242 states the following on criminal
sentencing: "The most appropriate correctional approach is
reintegrating the offender into the community, and the goals of
reintegration are furthered much more readily by working with the
offender within the community than by incarceration. Probation
should be authorized by the legislature in every case; exceptions
to the principle are not favored, and any exceptions, if made,
should be limited to the most serious of offenses, such as murder
or treason."

Considering that the uses include self defense, hunting, target shooting

	I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space
limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to
those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at
what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the
endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility
of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and
draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental
flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing
the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.
Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault
rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has
only range and acurracy going for it.

	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much
more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word
would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this
is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change
quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians
intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The
balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.

	That seems to be the case already, given that heavy
weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low
numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior
weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically
superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training
includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,
whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.

	I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers
of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the
heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman
tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders
from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,
though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should
therefore be jointly maintained and operated.

	This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control
over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state
to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that
the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,
I would have to assume that State control would rest on the
authority of the Governor and militia officers.

	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,
fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few
people with government support.  Just as you argued above that
the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control
so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this
situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding
all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.
I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that
the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the
unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.

	We have to assume that there would be those who would
side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all
the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.
I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the
local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their
armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the
tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.
I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.

>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds

	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to
outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to
call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster
than anything else.

>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of
>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to 
>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry
>arm of the regular army.

	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think
main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up
field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton
trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff
of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units
in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.

	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy
equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light
stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the
states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local
ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,
hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,
the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for
other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a
very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias
for these functions.

	Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck

Again, personal rights versus collective security.

	Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from
practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract
a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost "in a crowd of one"
than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of
the word "intimidation" and you can see where intimidation is not
the preferable method for the normal citizen.

	Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because
everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To
draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in
NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires
no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence
Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having
motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the
EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in
telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note
that our own state governments often play with game with the federal
government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.

>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.

	It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to
remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we
have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the
police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals
in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.

Even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,
but a search warrant.  In other words, there was no evidence of illegal
arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to
search for illegal evidence.

This is about the third person who's parroted the FBI's line about the
fires being set "six hours after the tear gas was injected."  Suppose you
want to explain to us the videotape footage shown on national TV last night
in which a tank with the gas-injecting tubes is pulling its injection tubes

Not to mention that the story was rewritten today. Those two BD's who
"admitted to starting the fire", forget 'em, they don't exist anyone.
Today, "a few saw someone starting a fire" and "our aerial surveillance
showed them starting fires" at this morning's press conference. 
Tomorrow, even this excuse may evaporate. A reporter pointed out
that a BD being brought to arraingement shouted that tanks knocking
over lanterns started the fire. Curiouser and curiouser.

Well, actually, the Davidians (Koreshians?) started the fire themselves, 
the last I heard ( around 15:00 EST). Eight people ran out into the feilds
surrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the 
fire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a 
great commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stove
burning on such a warm day?  Flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm 
is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory, the diluted CS gas
was inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start
burning until around 10:00 or 11:00.

Calm down kid. Vernon (Koresh's real name) said himself that he would not leave
that compound alive. The inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they 
may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over.

> I REPEAT, AS OF THIS TIME THERE ARE **NO  SURVIVORS**!

There are at least eight survivors. A caller on Rush Limbaugh today suggested
that the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers. That's not such a wild
idea considering their weaponry and resolve.

Sheesh! Get over it. I haven't heard (read) such ranting since the Hindenberg
burned. This should have ended 50 days ago. I'm glad my tax dollars have
finally stopped working to pay a bunch of guys to stand around and give press
conferences. Now they can get back to more important things, like catching
cigarrette smugglers.

I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the
fire.  They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have _accidentaly_
started the fire.  

>the buildings of the Branch Dividian ranch near Waco, TX. The
>lies from ATF say "holes were made in the walls and 'non-lethal' tear

From my understanding of the CNN report it was 6 HOURS after they started.

              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was 
first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle (the type used to 
tow tanks of battle fields) and not an armored flame-thrower vehicle.

>napalm, then let the wood stove inside ignite it.
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
in Texas.  It seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood
stove to ignite the "napalm" when the stove would probably not be in use.  And 
I doubt that it would have taken 6 hours to ignite it.

In short Mr. Gorman (I am assuming Mr. as a title because I don't think a woman
would be stupid enough to make this post) I don't know what episode of CNN you
were watching but it obviously was not the same one that I was watching or your
tears seamed to have blured your hearing along with your eye sight.

Please excuse any mispelled words as I am a product of the Arkansas education
system which Slick Willie of the "Double Bubba Ticket" has so greately improved
during his tenour as Governer of my great state (taking it from 49th in the 
nation in 1980 and allowing it to drop to 51st, how I don't know, and bringing
it to 44st and back to either 48th or 49th in 1990--sorry I can't rember the 
source of these numbers but they can be found).

I guess what I am really asking, like I did above, how does my government
who is my servent, tell me the soveriegn what I can or cannot possess?

It would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less
"criminal", by definition, than the act of possessing a television set. I also would seem
to me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if I harm
or kill someone with the machine gun or the television set that there 
would be specific penalties for doing such.

I have already called senators, legislators and the Governor demanding
that the warrants be unsealed, and that all involved in this atrocity
(including the President, Attorney General and Governor) be suspended
pending an investigation.

I seriously doubt, however, that anything will ever be done.

The latest news I saw was that two of the eight known survivors (not NO
SURVIVORS!!! as you so rudely put in all caps) said they started the
fire.

I won't go on with the things the wacko of Waco did.

Nor would they have died if they had come out with their hands empty.
That is undeniable truth.  My heart bleeds just as much as yours for 
the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities 
to do so.  My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion 
to not have the common sense to leave the compound when tanks came up 
and started dropping in tear gas early in the morning.

>You seem to say  
>they got what they deserved.

I do not think this.  However, if they did set the fire (which started in 
more than one place and spread very quickly), then they got what they 
wanted and put into motion themselves.

I see the BATF is going to be investigated by the Justice Dept. and likely 
by Arlen Spectre and congress.  This is good.  They have bungled the affair 
from the start.

Moreover, the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound, and as
far as I have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the
compound when the first shots were fired.  For all we know, these two
people may BE the agents, who would certainly be unlikely to stay around
and "cook" with the faithful...

Assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all.

Maybe I sound paranoid, but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on
how much David Koresh was a big, bad child abuser, and I kept wondering 
why she -- much less BATF -- wanted us to infer that she had any 
jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place.

I'm POSITIVE that the "sealed warrant" is not for child abuse.  What was
it for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE
last night about weapons violations.  Why?  Because she knows that such
a case is no longer believable?

The FBI released large amounts of CS tear gas into the compound in
Waco.  CS tear gas is a fine power.  Is CS inflammable.  Grain dust
suspended in air can form an explosive mixture, will CS suspended in air
form an explosive mix? Could large quantities of CS have fueled the
rapid spread of fire in the compound?

I paid my taxes.  There was no reference to sex or religion on the form.

Do you believe they would put impostors before the national tv cameras?

At this point, we are getting conflicting reports from the survivors.

I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective 
self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the
pro-RKBA arguments presented here.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a
million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring
criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number
of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However,
it is surprising that the "Evil AntiGun Empire " (Darth Vader
breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare
"All legitimate gun defenses" vs. "All gun crimes."  Instead, 
it's always "All legitimate gun defenses,"  which includes
cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and
cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just 
criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which
the victim died.

Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say
that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the
consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that
a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn
into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate
gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who
were deterred would have committed more crime or more
serious crimes had they not been deterred.

    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
  "bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.
  
Later in the same post:
     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are
"inclined" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those
claims are still ludicrous, however.

Previously Awesley had written:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

Prompting me to write:
  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

To which Awesley replied:
  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.

But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the
notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion
because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But
that too is ludicrous.

I wrote:
  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been

Awesley relied:
     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I've also
  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
  assert that I claimed they were truth.

Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. 
Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's
without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on
it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying
"this has gone far enough."  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis
for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. 
Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and
everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it
had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own
research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is
extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. 
Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I
do not.

I wrote:
  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 

Awesley wrote:
     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the

Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has
taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half
decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said "yes, I
shelled Americans," or "I gave the orders to fire the cannons," or "I
helped cover it up"?

Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. 
Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?

Awesley concludes:

I'd hardly call that "giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US";
the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil.  Still,

It was around 1969 in the Shenandoah Valley near Woodstock, Virginia.  Me,
my wife, a friend, his wife, and his 2 kids were hiking in a totally
desolate mountain area.  All of a sudden, large rocks began raining down
on us.  Looking up, we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocks
from what was an obvious stash.  They were a couple hundred feet above us.
Meanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the
punks were shrieking with laughter.  Me and my friend yelled for them to
knock it off.  They responded that we should "Get f***ed!".  Me and my
friend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above
their heads.  They ran.  With no more 3-5 pound rocks coming at our heads,
we proceeded on our journey.

Sorry, but me and my friend saw no need to let it evolve to a more
"violent" level than we were already experiencing.  I guess we should
have tried harder to understand and cope with the anger that society
had instilled in them and was driving them to do such things.  Guess
that's a cross I'll have to bear.

Does anyone know the particulars on the Senate File 303?
Does this bill allow or deny off-duty police from carrying concealed?

From what information that I have, Iowa has a discretionary permit policy
on CCW.  If S 303 allows police(off-duty) to carry concealed then I would
be inclined to oppose it.  I don't believe off-duty police officers should
have any more rights than civilians.  If law or policy prevents law-abiding
citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off-duty police
officer be treated any differently.  




Fact:  Both Janet Reno and Bill Clinton have admitted responsibility,
       even grief, over the deaths in Waco.

Fact:  Regardless of who started the fire, there are more than enough
       things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two.
       Cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?)
       come to mind.  

Fact:  It is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of
       law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty
       of life in prison.

Fact:  Impeachment is allowable for "high crimes and misdemeanors."
       Anything that's a federal felony should qualify.

Conclusion:  We have NO CHOICE, if we are an honest people, but to 
             impeach Mr. Clinton, and remove Reno from office.

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
"months of investigation" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of "9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!

This is REALLY STUPID nitpicking.  Capitalization rules in the late 18th
century were quite different from today, and what was posted matches current
capitalization rules.

We also don't make 's' look like 'f' and other such things done in the late
seventeen hundreds.

In the original Constitution, "militia", "arms", etc. were capitalized simply
because they were nouns.  This is also done currently in German.  There is
no special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized.
The capitalization denotes no special emphasis.

Here is a press release from the White House.

 President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are
remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session
with the press (Part 2 of 2):

     Go ahead, Sarah.

     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The
first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not
have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance
because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was
very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived
without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't
those people have a right to practice their religion?

     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their
religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had
violated federal laws, any number of them.

     Q  What federal laws --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't
answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the
whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they
were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but
it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of
the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of
this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were
speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that
the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have
escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.

     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground
compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be
sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if
the children were not released immediately outside that the humane
thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace
where they could be protected.

     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned
yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas
was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks
themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they
all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a
nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.

     MS. MYERS:  Last question.

     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --

     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked
Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you
learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your
mind during those horrendous moments?

     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had
considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --
and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the
public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that
the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues
concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would
be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in
the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were
right or wrong, of course, we will never know.

     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the
building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate
concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were
escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.
That's the first thing I wanted to know.

     Thank you.

     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a
Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't
have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't
go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I
take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I
signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to
make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had
elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,
if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.
And I do support her.

     She is not ultimately responsible to the American
people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an
appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as
well as she could have.

     Thank you.  (Applause.)

Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the
people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are
there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority
could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.
and it would fly using the logic above.

When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,
there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis
is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those
who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a
majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting
the hangee.

What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the
limitations on the government, probably because they know that the
people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind
tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has
been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just
shows how gullible the people have become to "I am from the government
and am here to help you sort of line".  We have been lied to, fed
half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control
laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on
force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able
to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch
of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers
sure as hell didn't, either.

	That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining

	SeAL Team six should have handled it?  Delta Force?  The
BATF had more than enough equipment and men.  They did not have
good intel, but they did have poor planning.  They fucked up.  Even
in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do

	And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF
has shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons,
and exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing
more than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an
oath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document
that stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should
be up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's
the whole reason for any of this.

	Yeah, I've been related to many of them.  This is flame-bait,
right?  I'm not paying your price.  Mind if I sight in my guns on
your body?  Think of it as the price you have to pay that we may all
live without fear of my making a stray shot.  It's fine and dandy to
revel in the other guy being the target and your supposed safety.  In
the military, we called this "chicken shit."  Leadership from the rear.
The War on Drugs, despite being a catchy term for nothing more than
a continuation of policy since before this century, seems to have
gotten you convinced that my rights aren't worth your good vibes.
Mind if I cut your net access, as well as access to any and all forms
of expression?  See, you make me nervous, what with you being able
to influence so many.  I'm sure you can see how this is the price we
have to pay for freedom and liberty in this country, as well as
a fair and unbiased judiciary.

	Mind if we include you in the body count?  I'm sure we could
all file it under "civic improvement" and your life wouldn't have
been sacrificed in vain.  If you like, you can will your estate to
defecit reduction, too.  Now, when you learn how the law protects, or
doesn't protect, everybody equally and how our collective boot may
one day be on your collective throat, perhaps at that time you will
mature enough to realize just what you're talking about and how
serious this is.

	Next time, include a smiley.  While I hesitate to think that
you could have meant this seriously, it deserved a small flame anyway.

This means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough.  Good.

I would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon
whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic
nuclei.  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses 
in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause 
death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of
people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or
cropland.  


Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for
research purposes on such chemicals.

I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
definitions.

Nope.  It is not considered a weapon.

It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are
banned for other reasons.

Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on
something I've been thinking about for some time.  Over the last few
years I have heard of one case after another of government running
completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the
government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I
intend to put together what I call the "American Horror File": a
compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod
over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing
especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,
and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,
but including any other cases for which I can find decent
documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,
red-hot enraged at their government.

The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text
and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent
years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage
people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and
print out copies and give them to neighbors.

This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on
how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer
information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific
instances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to
join me in collecting and researching information for this project.

Here's something Preston Covey (professor of ethics at CMU) wrote:

Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)


Folks,

Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal
carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled "Armed Force."  I
felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat
that "A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect."  I sent
the following to the WSJ.

-----

Gun Stats & Mortal Risks

Preston K. Covey


	Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~
2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns
in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King
County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more
likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to
kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it
has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated
by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of
the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine
(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping
firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ 
 
	Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of
bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: 
What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither
the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the
risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control
do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of
cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the
risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful
here. 

	The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us
off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a
misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice
and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far
outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your
car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or
an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not
take the bus?  

	Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company
of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at
stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:

	The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the
number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense
(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed
by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation
is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other
cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12
accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided
by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King
County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of
homes unaccounted.

	The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on
six counts:

	1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or
acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and
neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is
that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,
dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,
but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are
relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the
calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless
Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is
criminological hogwash.

	2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs
populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories
-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited
by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities
like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is
very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but
avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with
histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and
certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious
risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as
ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither
gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or
vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver
crucially affect the risk. 

	3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is
that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill
than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of
personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike
Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43
times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this
particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about
whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by
tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question
begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any
case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal
instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths
are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility
obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by
gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to
NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. 
People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their
homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection
course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and
sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death
as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard
and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they
disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and
other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we
resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose
norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign
us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in
the matter.

	4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the
NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,
including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total
death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other
studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from
homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these
suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true
that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously
true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these
suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of
research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is
wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce
L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,
1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of
Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of
the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to
~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the
causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a
profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally
disregard this issue.

	5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable
rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the
NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. 
But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled
self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case
dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of
justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story
on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women
who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,
1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic
cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were
reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported
that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In
Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error
by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged
by promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 

	6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation
are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The
divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not
aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even
shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the
coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy
is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure
the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as
opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or
deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where
no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed
to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the
compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by
criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,
Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?
	Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are
based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is
high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare
better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance
or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year
by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and
accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable
statistic than the NEJM scare stat:  

A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or
other crime than to kill anybody.   

	Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;
what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We
should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation
of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. 
Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by
uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we
can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we
hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.

The FBI and Koresh were calling the shots.  And there were very sane reasons  
for keeping the children, if they let them go, the parents would NEVER see them

If you do not believe this, you are truly naive.  It is not only possible, it  
is easy.  I worked in the broadcast profession, at a network station, in the  
late 70s, I know what I'm saying here.  Embarrasing footage is easy to get, add

The news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position.  Do you

No reported has ever sued the government for such a situation.  They know the  
dangers.  Remember, the BATF invited the initial coverage. And how about a  
simple, remote-controlled, camera or two?  There were ways to provide media  
access.  The FBI obviously just didn't want any.

I can find several.  Tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the

"I'm always rethinking that.  There's never been a day when I haven't rethought

On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to
tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  If
there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or 
any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the
chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with
respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas 
contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would
peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.
If they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't
be too far fetched.  Throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and
subject to psychological warfare, and all bets on functional abilities are off.
Anybody tried to get Amnesty International to jump in on this one?

That you know of.

While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and
got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I
left two years later, there were no clues.

Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is "no big deal" if you are
the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail,
waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put
criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would
drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very
early.

Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the
invention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a

Yes, the problem is the user.  Question back (since you are one of the rational

controls?

They did not believe, from experience, that the "police" (including National
Guard) could/would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human being
does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  What
would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and
also likely armed with stolen firearms?

Criminals would move to Scandinavia??? :-)  The average criminal would look for

Personally, I criticize the fools who send money to the IRA to "make Ireland
free".  Of course, this is the last thing the IRA wants, because they lose
power if England pulls out.  But that's for another group.

>Don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either.

The U.S. has roughly 20 times the major sporting events as the U.K..  How many

Hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here.  I guess
that's where the different cultures thing comes in.

Hi,

In Canada, any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's a
small metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this is
that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the
National Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.

I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer
to Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with
nature on it's own terms.

Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there
being a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct
me if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an "off" position or an "on" position
because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position
for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is
correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course
if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that
easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16.
How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between
semi-auto and fully-auto fire?

Actually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out

Well, what about what I said above?  If that is correct I guess TV would be
acceptable (if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower 
receiver of the AR-15/M-16).

That's why zoologists refer to you as a 'fecal shield'. Colonel Semen 
M. Budienny, a subsequent Soviet military fame, said about the 
Armenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless Turkish and Kurdish 
women, children and elderly people during his visit to Anatolia 
in June 1919 that

"the Armenians had become troublemakers, their Hinchakist
 and Dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys
 of whatever power happened to be ascendent."

In September 16, 1920, Major General W. Thwaites, Director of
Military Intelligence, wrote to Lord Hardinge, Under-Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs:

"...it is useless to pretend that the Armenians are satisfactory
 allies, or deserving of all the sympathy to which they claim."[1]

[1] F.O. 331/3411/158288.

In the Special Collection at Stanford Hoover Library, donated by
Georgia Cutler, the letter dated Nov. 1, 1943 states that

"Prescot Hall wrote a large volume to prove that Armenians were
 not and never could be desirable citizens, that they would 
 always be unscrupulous merchants."

So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to
Islam. Or, to convert me to ANYTHING. 

There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.

'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or
my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.

This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some
friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches
and cheap booklets about some church ....

And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert 
everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.


Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related
violence' ? 

Why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care 
your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are)
as long as you want to change their thinking.

Never. I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an 
index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned 
and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude 
of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien
population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total
population and they did it only within a time period of a little over
two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.

Now I would like to ask you:

  Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to 
  this one?

And again I would like to ask you:

  Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands
  of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a "Final
  Solution" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not
  to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to
  Jewish problems?

First, my above statement doesnot say that "the existence of israeli citizens
in the WB revoke their right of life" but it says "the israeli occupation
of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically
revokes the right of for its military men". Clearly, occupation is an
undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. 

Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to
protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing
Palestinean human rights.

So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.

Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in , if you were a

because the same Rabbi Shoham had said "Yes, Zionism is racism".
If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes, then drop Zionism.
If you are not Zionist, why are you bothered then. You should join me in
condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts.

Still in the threatening stage.. Maybe when there is no more Bosnians,
the UN will lift the arms Embargo on them! Military intervention? that

Anybody is still convinced that this is not a religious war?
A psychopath like Karadzik is considered a peacelover.. Of course he
sent 100,000 muslims to permanent peace. With the blessings of Patriarch
Pavle.

Who is the you Arabs here.  Since you are replying to my article you
are assuming that I am an Arab.  Well, I'm not an Arab, but I think you
are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said.  The
bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in Lebanon by Israel is
very consistent with its policy of intimidation.  That is the only
policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in
the middle east!

I was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering.
Like I said, I'm not an Arab but if I was, say a Lebanese, you bet
I would defende my homeland against any invader by any means.

  Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as
  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement
  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel
  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:

  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform
     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female
     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but
     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of
     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further
     provocation is required.

  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant
     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans
     without positive identification as military personnel, clear
     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.

    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for
       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively
       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or
       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note
       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,
       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive
       military identification and require closer inspection such
       as document checks.

    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,
       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less
       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals
       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a
       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,
       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.
       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to
       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify
       armed response.

    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive
       military identification of all personnel in the target area of
       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not
       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft
       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the
       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously
       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of
       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov
       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to
       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should
       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.
       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters
       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated
       if necessary.

Tell me then, would you also fight the Syrians in Lebanon?

Oh, no of course not. They would be your brothers and you would
tell that you invited them.

It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not, there is some reasonable
thought in what you say here an I appreciate your point. However, I would make 2
remarks: 

 - you forgot about hate, and this is not only at government level.
 - It's not only 'arab' governments.

Now, about taugh talk and arrogance, we are adults, aren't we ? Do you listen 
to tough talk of american politicians ? or switch  the channel ? 
I would rather be 'intimidated' by some dummy 'talking tough' then by a 
bomb ready to blow under my seat in B747.

Making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything (not
mentioning peace or agreement). I also know several tens of jokes about arabs
(palestinians) but I DO NOT post them to Usenet (Anyway,not to THIS newsgroup),
since I don't think I will achieve any target but making other parts furious,and
this is NOT my target.
If this is your target...well...that tells a lot about you.

Yeah,well,sometimes,when cowards put their children and wives in the front line,
so their enemy cannot do anything,well,maybe in those cases,you have no better
thing to do (to save your life) than shooting. And if parents want their
children alive,I think it would be better that before they get out to throw
stones/molotov botlles,or when they come to kill soliders,to keep their children
in the houses.

Well,It was about 3 years ago ,in the Intifada (The fact that  you can't
remember the time prooves how much do you care about it). I DO NOT think
that what the soliders did was correct. But I will not agree that they "were
breaking their arms".I saw that film,and,unlike in the USA,it was broadcasted
entirely not long ago (in a talk show) and at the end the "arm-broken" guys got
up and walked and used their arms very good. They guy who did it was interviewed
and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take
his orders,and spitted in his face. What ammount of truth exist in this
statement I cannot tell you,because I wasn't there. But the guy who did it was
in prison,if it makes you any good.

No,it didn't. The Israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle
east.It is still the only human army(as much as an ARMY can be human).To any
American who will claim the opposite,I can only remember the CNN broadcasting
of the American Solider who beat a Somalian boy. It was very cruel to see.But
I won't say because of this that the American army is cruel.

Smart indeed.  If what you're saying is true, Greeks who visit are happy,
the Turkish merchants are happy; who is harmed?  No one.  So not only was
it a smart move, it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of
200.000 Greeks per week and however many Turkish merchants they interact with.
One simple move in the paperwork arena -> lotsa happy people of both 
nationalities.  Just and observation.

Where the hell do you get off calling it "Arab land"?  Jews have been
living there for a long time.  Jews didn't just start arriving in 1900,
they've been living there for thousands of years, except for periods when
they were expelled but they always returned home.

I will again *repeat* my statement: 1) I *do not* condone these 
*indiscriminate* Israeli acts (nor have I *ever*, 2) If the villagers do not know who these "guerillas" are (which you stated earlier), how do you expect the

*is why* the "guerillas" prefer to lose themselves in the general population 
by dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).

I agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these
attacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its
situation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control
this "third party state" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept
occuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do
something ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?

It is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside
party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angola
had the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn't) stop anti-Angolan
guerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africa
refused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola,
would Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying that
Angola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?

I refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from
Lebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. 

One hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its 
border but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS 
CHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the 
Lebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it 
EASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That
**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*
have been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions.

I fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be "used" by EITHER side,
and have been (and continue to be). But the most fundamental issue is that
if a state cannot control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so, it
should expect others to do it for them. Hopefully that "other" will be
the UN but it is (as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia) weak.

Suffering from a severe case of myopia? No Muslim left alive - not a 
single one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman 
border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman 
Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who 
assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman 
parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces 
who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname "Murad", 
especially ordering that 

         'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in 
          whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children 
          also should be killed as they form a danger to the 
          Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]

 [1] M. Varandian, "History of the Dashnaktsutiun," p. 85.

Another former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian 
guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately,
in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all 
the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy 
conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a 
telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in 
April 21, 1915, "thanking it for its services to Russia." The Armenian 
newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly 
reported in May 24, 1915 that 

"only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered."

"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia." 
 (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of 
 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead."

"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake."

"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves."

"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies."

"...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final
 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:

 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the
  Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining
  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey
  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new
  free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]

to strike the Ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to St. Petersburg
confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul."

Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State 
are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:

	"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State
	governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public
	peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;
	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental
	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution."

Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing
the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The
fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be
attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.
The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.
Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force
only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.

The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and
the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution
of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing
the power of the Parliament and the government.

The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the
occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was
abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the
occupying forces.

During the Independence War, the "Turkish Grand National Assembly" held their
first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new
Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish
Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new
Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal 
backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a 
multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by
others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been
based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national
sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.

"Major Principles of the Constitution"

The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic
within the following principles:

- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by 
  law;
- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,
  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;
- The language of the State is Turkish;
- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.
  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;
- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This
  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;
- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;
- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the
  Turkish nation;
- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,
  sex, or political beliefs;
- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.

"Structure of the State"

In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the
principle of "division of power" to create a balanced and self-controlled
system. The power is divided into "legislative power," "executive power," and
"judicial power," balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each
other (self-control).

 A. Legislative Power:

 The "Turkish Grand National Assembly" is a parliament with one House, elected
 by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on
 behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:

 - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;
 - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;
 - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;
 - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;
 - to ratify international agreements;
 - to grant amnesty or pardons.

 Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral
 or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is
 divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is
 calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age
 of twenty-one can vote.

 Elections are supervised by the "Supreme Council of Elections," which solves
 all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local "Board of Election"
 runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the
 Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among 
 independent judges.

 B. Executive Power:

 The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government
 as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:

 - to represent the State and the Country;
 - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;
 - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;
 - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;
 - to ratify laws and government decrees.
 
 The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven
 years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may 
 call for a referendum.

 Executive power is exercised by the "Council of Ministers," headed by the
 Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the
 members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval
 by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their
 program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)
 Ministers in the Council.

 Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent
 "administrative" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or
 functions against any law.

 C. Judicial Power:

 Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can
 instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be 
 discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the
 reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories
 of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:

 - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The 
   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice
   upon the appeal of the parties involved.
 - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime
   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in
   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.
   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the
   high administrative court.

 The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the
 "Constitutional Court" if they contradict the Constitution. If found
 contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.

 WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi 
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to "the extermination of the
Jewish race"--went on display Friday at the National Archives.
	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.
	"The notes give them their authenticity," said Robert Wolfe,
a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  "He was
supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his
own rules."
	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.
	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than
100 German secret police generals.  "I also want to talk to you,
quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.
I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish
race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written."  [Emphasis mine--rje]
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
"extermination" is *Ausrottung*.
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be "extirpation"
or "tearing up by the roots."
	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,
"Judenevakuierung" or "evacuation of the Jews."  But archives
officials said "extermination" is the word he actually
spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.
	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's "final solution of the
Jewish question," committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.
	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 26.
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and
an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.

You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians.
With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over
all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or
recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it.
By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they
should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish 
people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever
showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected 
to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate 
the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. 
Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To 
assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings 
was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom 
free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established 
a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two 
continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and 
Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in 
espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and 
Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under 
German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National 
Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional 
Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, 
Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often 
expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,
during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and
cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication
in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]

"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 "...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!
  I don't need your bias."

That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in 
the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.  
Should we be happy when they die?  As I said before, the question is not
whether or not you agree with the policies of Israel.  You may wish for the
Israelis to cease occupation, but don't rejoice in death.

This a "tried and true" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:
to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the
opposing "state" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,
in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the
people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the
innocent civilians into harm's way.

Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel
should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking
another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
innocent lives?

Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of "demilitarized" or "buffer"
zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory
of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly
surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to 
do it themselves.

>If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  

What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states 
can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will
only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the 
responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their 
soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some "guaratees"), there is no way
Israel is going to accept their "word"- not with their past attitude of 
tolerance towards "anti-Israel guerillas in-residence".

Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop
anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows
them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and
'67. Somehow, with that "limitation" on the troops "powers" I don't
think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) "guarantees" by other parties, the UN is worthless
to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a "ruse"?).

Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is
the feeling that it is better that "many of us die fighting
against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently 
accept our fate." If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of 
suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,
Arab and Islamic groups.

From Israel's perspective, "concessions" gets it NOTHING...except the 
realization that it has given "something" up and now *can only 
hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken
back* by merely doing so; to "take back" tangible items (land,
control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should
stay away from.
 
Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades 
before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.
The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel 
would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state 
involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure 
in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts 
committed by "private groups", 3) Israel would prepare for the next 
round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and
don't be so idiotic as to suggest "trust" for the motivations of
present-day Arab states)?

>There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese

Ah, ok...what is "different" about the present situation that tells
us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic 
policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague "political factors"
but about those "tangible" (just like that which Israel gave up)
factors that "guarantee" the responsibility of those states. Your
assessment of "difference" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,
and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that
sort of thing.

It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,
Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.
Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain 
control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level.
The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in 
their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and 
independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and 
fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal 
they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million 
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.

And, you don't pull nations out of a hat.

This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: 

a) Dro (the butcher), the former Dictator of the Armenian Dictatorship and
the architect of the Genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds, the most 
respected of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional 
Republic in Berlin during World War II; 

b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social 
theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members 
of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' 

c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, 

d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 20,000 members which fought side 
by side with the Wehrmacht.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'
is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during 
the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, 
assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people 
because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts 
of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, 
set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts 
behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly 
attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population 
indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent 
Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with 
axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt
alive as can be seen below.

Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions 
of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and 
Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,
also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from 
behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of 
Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed 
widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena
was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from 
Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide 
by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, 
Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French 
journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century
committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.

The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, 
Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their 
villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.
The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for
humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,
Austrian, French and American authorities.

Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and 
cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by 
Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish 
and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. 
Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of 
the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

"I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and
 Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months
 have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I
 have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at 
 almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from
 Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly
 slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to
 save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful
 events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then
 taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people 
 well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these
 places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.
 They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
 Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality
 problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers
 who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and
 Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the 
 Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. 
 I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is 
 destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are 
 speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as 
 well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is 
 proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war."

1. There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs
   to place a new electric lamp. The answer is nine: one stays on a table and
   holds the lamp, four hold the table and turn it and yet four run around the
   table in opposite direction not to make the first feel bad (when being
   turned). Pitily, it lacks this kind of dark humour as Nick's msg does.
2. To my mind the signature should be smth like:

                  /       _                     __        /  .
                /_______/_/_______________    /________ /____/
         /___ /      _                  /

Hehehe.

BTW, does the Litani River not flow West and not South? I think that its waters
stay entirely within Lebanese territory and so what Hasan says about the Jordan
River makes no sense, in any case. The Hasbani River, on the other hand, flows
into the Jordan, if I am not mistaken.

I know this paper well, and see it for the exercise in selective morality 
and judgement it is. Until such time as it recognizes that *any* religiously
based government is racist, exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy
of "separate but equal" second-class treatment of minorities, it will 
continue to be known for its bias. If Jewish nationalism is racism, so is 
Islam; anywhere where people are allotted "different rights" according to 
race, religion or culture is "racist".

If you want info claiming that blacks were brought to earth 60 trillion
years ago by Aliens from the plante Shabazz, I can send you literature from
the Nation of Islam (Farrakhan's group) who believe this.

If you want info claiming that the Holocaust never happened, I can send you
info from IHR (Institute for Historical Review - David Irving's group), or
just read Dan Gannon's posts on alt.revisionism.

I just wanted to put Steve's post in with the company that it deserves.

MASSACRE UNCOVERED....

By ANATOL LIEVEN,

More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have 
been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims 
that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.

Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley 
and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's 
massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.

From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of 
Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters 
of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their 
own lines.

We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last 
troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. 
They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov, 
who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert 
to ease their departure.

A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their 
dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the 
same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian 
positions.

In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another 
31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures 
do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed 
the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also 
do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies

Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 
people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came 
by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and 
of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies 
we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. 
The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which
killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. 
All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly 
clothing of workers.

Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national 
volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, 
including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS, 
APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED 
IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.

SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD 
INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY 
SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks 
                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'
                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)
                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists 
                            a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)






Dear Mr. Davidsson,

   You claim that your purpose is to fight racism.  But you don't
seem to have any interest in injustice except that which may have
been committed by Israel.  The treatment of Jews in Arab nations,
an injustice of staggerring proportions, is an injustice that you
do not seem to care the least bit about.  Why not?

The Litani river flows in a west-southwestern direction and indeed does
not run through the buffer zone.  The Hasbani does flow into the Jordan
but contrary to what our imaginative poster might write, there has been
no increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to
climatic changes in rainfall.

Dear Mr. Karageorgiou,
I would like to clarify several misunderstandings in your posting. First the    bus incident which I believe was in Canakkale three years ago, was done by a    mentally ill person who killed himself afterwards. The Pontus Greeks were ex-   changedwith Turks in Greece in 1923. I have to logout now since my Greek friend
Yiorgos here wants to use the computer. Well, I'll be back.Asta la vista baby.

The village I described was actually the closest I could come to
describing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian
population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and
thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining 
inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go.
But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like
mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are
often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some
have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others
are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is
not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla
tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with
the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that
use women and children as shields, but because that is the only
way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.

Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though
Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance
operation and better motivated by religious conviction.

  As to retaliation,

It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses
its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on
sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the 
attackers came from that specific village but has no further
intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against 
civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show
that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked.
Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and
indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side.
I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions,
this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than 
Israeli troops.

I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still
contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's
security, since it would reduce its  military losses, and I claim
that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any 
further attacks on Northern Israel.

Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better.
I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would
be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for
Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be
involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the
negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants
to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities
along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations
back in question.

From Israeline 4/16

Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car
Bomb Explosion
 
Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car
bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and
wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of
a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas
exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the
other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an
Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement.
An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may
have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at
the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the
blast suffered light to moderate injuries.



The Arab that was killed was a probably from the Mossad so it is not count 
as a murder.

You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who
can declare "total" victory and then sit back and enjoy the
applause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few
rigged "quotations" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir
Yassin "massacre."

You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.
At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big
difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding
"quotations" that support your preset opinions.

If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that
many of the sources of your "quotations" have an axe to grind, and
therefore you must be very careful about whom you "quote."  For
example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,
and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of
his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience
shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his
anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be
considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of
course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy
"quotation" that you can use to attack Israel.

Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a "scholar"
when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.
It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an
attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at
the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,
you will see his "indictment" to be pure hot air.  And this is the
BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning
evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as
"scholarly," he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see
that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.

The Deir Yassin "massacre" never took place as the propagandists
tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila "massacres." Do you get
the feeling people like to blame the Jews for "massacres," even if
they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews
like to do it, for reasons of their own.

Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin "massacre" stuff
with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version
unless you find something serious to contradict it.

This is not small. A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies
a doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people
seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists,
for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates,
but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things
like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation,
and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's
rain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than 
the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards
in Iran.

	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday
ruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations
with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that
government disassociates itself from international terrorism.
	``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the
Gulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility
towards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistant
secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said.
	The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour''
which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab
Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.
	Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but
first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''
	Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting
Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high
on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''
	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren
Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere
else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term
plan to station troops in the Gulf.
	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to
pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''
	``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect
compliance,'' Mack told delegates.

Subject: Final Solution for Gaza ?


Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ?
------------------------------------

While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they
repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
attempt to starve the Gazans.

The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel.

While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors.

As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops
and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race.

The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the
right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the
occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some
Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over
Gaza through Arab collaborators.

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude
is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The
current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are
consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister
Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask
oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution
up their sleeve ?

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and
political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

I understand how israel captured the teritory and feels that it
is its right to annex it. I can't fully understand why it has
to deal with palestinians much the same way jews were treated
before the holocaust (the Final Solution) by Hitler. What I
totally don't get is why the U.S. has to subsidize the
existance of such a thorough abuser of human rights.

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and
imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the
case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason
to believe it still goes on.

From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992

PUBLICATION BAN

        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many
        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were
        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of
        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever
        being made public.

By Baruch Me'iri

All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way
or another: "Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I
will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific
case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something
which may legally not be published".

The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years
there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to
long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the
crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More
precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of
their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.

In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of
this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about
the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,
for security offenses, in complete secrecy.

In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]
affair -- we heard about "the third man" being in prison.  But many
years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no
longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former
Communist countries.

But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.

The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and
Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this
week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet
Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:

"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been
imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of
these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the
specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but
even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after
being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison
without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the
prisoner", asserts MK Zucker.

On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, "There is
absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is
imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of
security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases
the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances
under which a trial will not be held in public.

"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on
the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person
sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of
Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to
know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public
sight and his descent into the abyss of prison."

Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of
Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider
the question.  "The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the
cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The
State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention
and its cause is kept secret", wrote Zucker.

The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai
Shiffman said that, "We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any
cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,
and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation
which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like
censorship is an unhealthy matter".

"The Union is aware", says Shiffman, "of cases where notification of a
suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am
speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee
was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole
first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.

"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --
can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where
the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The
journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is
happy..."

Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the
laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a
person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. 
"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's
that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long
years in prison without us knowing anything about it."

-- Do you find this situation acceptable?

Attorney Arnon: "Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and
such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that
publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but
total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of
Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged
with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The
trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for
those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,
though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least
are aware of his imprisonment."

-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the
discretion of the court?

Attorney Arnon: "The judges have no choice but to trust the
presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to
investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which
they can misuse."

-- And what if there really is a security issue?

Attorney Arnon: "I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.
 Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible
to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without
entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning
publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller
murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the
matter being made public."

Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can
be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's
arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  "A healthy
situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere
publication may be harmful to state security".

A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former
advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda
Meir.  "Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such
situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must
be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom
of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom
which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.

"Nevertheless", adds Shtendal, "the legislator allowed for the
possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the
damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that
which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.
The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with
the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which
we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has
been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt."

Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: "As a rule, clearly such a
phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in
the most extreme circumstances."

The American people didn't have any problem with it too (Clinton). Actually I
think that it does not make any difference as long as they have the
qualifications to become leaders. BTW in my political view I hope  (and should be 
the Arab hope too) that Binyamin Netanyahu will not be ellected as prime minister 
of Israel.

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.
Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about
anti-trust in the business world.

Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines
and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says
that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
investing, you can not acquire a large number of those
shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so
only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,
the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.
They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.

The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /
multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours
was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair
market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of
an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist
myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).

Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get
on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its
OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is
a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it
has an integer square root.

Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that
every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in
Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an
escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with
you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,
just being rethorical.

Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic
within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).
Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic
cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the
international community, or make the best out of a no win
condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the
'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the
arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So
yes, they're there. But as a community with history and
roots, its dead.

I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not
predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no
problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were
predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest
Palestine?

"Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies"

While World Human Rights Organizations Scream, Greeks 
Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity
of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu.


Dr. Sadik Ahmet, Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament, Visits US

Washington DC, July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet, one of the two ethnic
Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through
July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and
high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York.

At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC,
Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated
six demands from Greek government.

Ahmet said "our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from
Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights.
What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same
as South African Apartheid." He added: "What we are facing is pure
Greek hatred and racial discrimination."

Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece
he said "We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic
Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this
people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens
and are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in
the Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are
not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of
Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in
the United States."

"We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek
government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights.
Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek
government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating
our buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are
not hired to the government offices."

"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity
in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the
economic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license
necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact
that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the
necessary steps in my career."

"We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed
to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of
law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself
a Turk."

"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion."

In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated
that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of
Greek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example,
he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki)
and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not
want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said
that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out
of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated
this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification
requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes,
they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including
the Turkish candidates.

Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947.
He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974.
he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.

In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time
by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation
of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police
for collecting signatures.

Would it be asking too much for you to DOCUMENT these allegations of
"Israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters"? I think you confuse
Israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion
of a free, unmonitored by the government, press corps would be a joke.

As for the notion that Israel threatens the human rights of Palestinians by
sealing off the Gaza strip, get real. When the Palestinian-on-Palestinian
civil war stops and all Palestinians can behave like mature human beings,
Israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace. Not before.

What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum?  It is the home of the muslim a
s well as jewish religion, among others.  Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitza
k Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the
 way Abdul Nidal does today.  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so theref
ore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does.

Sinai had several big cities that were avcuated when isreal gave it back to
Egypth, but for a peace agreement. So it is my opinin that the settlers will not
be an obstacle for withdrawal as long it is combined with a real peace agreement
with the Arabs and the Palastinians.

Based on the same reasons?  You mean you were opposed to US intervention in
Somalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world,
the desire to help Somalia is racist?  I don't think this "same reason" applies
to Somalia at all.

The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more
willing to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what
the "fixation on European countries" theory would predict.  (Similarly, the
desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite
of what that theory predicts.)

I'm referring to people who want to help at all, of course.  You don't see
people sending out press releases "help Bosnian Serbs with ethnic cleansing!
The Muslim presence in the Balkans should be eliminated now!"  (Well, except
for some Serbs, but I admit that the desire of Serbs in America to help the
Serbian side probably _is_ because those are people more like them.)

	The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak
	------------------------------------

		"On the ancient peak of Ararat
		The centuries have come like seconds
		And passed on."
				-Avetik Issahakian

by Yuri Danilov

Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: "What
books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?" And 
though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, 
depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, 
and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, 
not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at
least one book of arithmetic problems.

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they 
were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for "numbers" (though 
secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because 
they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern 
mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't 
know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were 
no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a 
specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: "I willingly confess that 
any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was
a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of 
my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route
--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid 
using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is 
well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, 
nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers
(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It 
seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade 
teachers."

Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the 
bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to 
recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most 
fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a 
relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to
Venus and back.

			One for the "road"

	They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley 
	glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with 
	a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. "God 
	knows what this kind of stuff leads to," thought Kingsley.

	The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History 
	of Herodotus. "Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides," thought 
	the Royal Astronomer.
					--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud

The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 
elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same
time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these 
problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian 
architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is 
now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant 
letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of 
Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.

An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a 
bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions
of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh 
Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).

The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way 
of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and 
worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years 
the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in 
Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just
anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk 
Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has 
brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the 
general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable 
problem book.

		Vardapet Anania of Shirak

	Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no 
	philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering 
	it the mother of all wisdom.
					--Anania of Shirak

Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because 
of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his 
work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and
Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation
of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and
Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last
work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, 
Movses of Khoren).

In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:

	I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our
	Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, 
	in the expression of the psalmist, "every day I illuminated the 
	eyes of my mind." Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,
	I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, 
	the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia 
	neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the 
	sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man 
	named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me
	that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,
	Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But 
        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but 
        only of certain fragmentary facts.

	I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: 
	"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the 
	coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full 
	of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature." I asked 
	them how they knew this. They answered: "We saw ourselves that many 
	people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. 
	Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,
	Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become 
	pupils of Tyukhik." When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to 
	God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.

	I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I 
	had come. He received me graciously and said: "I praise Our Lord that 
	He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. 
	Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself 
	lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there." 
	Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with 
	me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated 
	the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students
	at the king's court began to envy me.

	I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not 
	been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable 
	collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, 
	books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why 
	enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did 
	not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating
	that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into 
	Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the 
	translation read as if the work were written in that language 
	originally.

	Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had 
	learned the Armenian language. "When I was young," he said, "I lived 
	in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and 
	for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I 
	served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and 
	literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was 
	wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to 
	the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: "If You prolong my life, 
	I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to 
	collecting treasures of knowledge." And the Lord heard my prayers. 
	After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria 
	and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher 
	from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned 
	to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people."

	After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for 
	him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to 
	assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to 
	God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because
	of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study 
	with him.

	And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from 
	him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our 
	country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's 
	help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me 
	for my efforts.

				Problems and Solutions

	A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed
	on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; 
	one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and 
	forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many 
	copies were printed in all.
					--Imitation of Anania of Shirak

A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli ("books have their own fate").
The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The
manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to 
Armenian historians, "in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded 
from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children." Biding
their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of 
ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).
And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two 
manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction 
and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, 
annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a 
member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).

In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are "amusing, full of life, 
and simple." Orbeli goes on to say: "The subjects of the problems are 
generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland 
Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are 
named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a 
contemporary of Anania." Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used 
only "aliquots" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is
necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to 
represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).

Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the 
retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their 
full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.

Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 
572.

Problem 1

My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the 
Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary 
heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. 
The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, 
pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third 
time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were 
still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from 
this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.

Problem 8

During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak
Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the
Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a 
day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent 
riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in 
a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.

Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian 
translation, they are all called "dishes." But in the original Armenian, 
according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are 
called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian 
word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before 
Anania's Problems and Solutions.

Problem 18

There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the 
metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from
one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten 
drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.

Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in 
Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.

Problem 7

Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank 
of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. 
We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped
out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found 
forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.

The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself
and offer you just one more.

Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that 
inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no
mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according 
to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of 
Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .

Problem 20

The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, 
was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild
donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, 
running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with
his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild 
beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by 
arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were 
caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And 
so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.

		"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli"

	His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a 
	bibliography.
				-- K Uzbashyan, Academician
					Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli

Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the 
solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation 
of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,
has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, 
and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great 
attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for 
a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma 
attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An 
advertisement at the end of the book reads: "This book was typeset in 
December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by 
me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with 
borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project 
to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman."

Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned 
orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage 
Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had 
already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis 
Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its 
rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish 
the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian 
churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve 
the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.
Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the 
blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)

When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times 
were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania
was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the 
printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the 
Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion
of Russian academic typography.

Let's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high 
schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman 
crater on the far side of the Moon. Maybe one of the space travelers will take 
this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read 
this article and say to himself: "This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty 
interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems."

Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then
there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And 
we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by 
Iosef Orbeli.

DEPOSITION OF ZAVEN ARMENAKOVICH BADASIAN

   Born 1942
   Employed
   Sumgait Bulk Yarn Plant

   Resident at Building 34, Apartment 33
   Microdistrict No. 12
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


On February 27 my wife and I went to Baku to go shopping and returned to 
Sumgait at around five in the evening. We ran into one of my relatives at the 
bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,
near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a
fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, "What are you
standing here for? Go home immediately!" I asked, "What's going on?" He says, 
"What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're 
killing Armenians!" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.

We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our 
courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were 
about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They
were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice 
or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.
They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and 
throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one 
has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a 
guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.

We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School 
No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families 
there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only 
known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani 
guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was 
nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We 
were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our 
microdistrict.

We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.

On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be
used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of 
them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I
asked him for assistance. I say, "We're in School No. 33, we need to be 
evacuated." Well he says, "Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now."

I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with
him personally. When I called he said, "Muslimzade here."

About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out
the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, "Armenians, come 
out, we're here to get you." They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in 
their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, "Where should I go?" I 
say, "If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that 
the Armenians were here and that they left." That's what he did. He went down 
there and said, "The Armenians were here," he said, "I let them out the back 
door, they went that way." And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and 
noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.

So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!
Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that
Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that 
we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the 
morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.

In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers 
took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there 
were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, 
about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, 
nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was
just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything
they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his 
mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...

I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I
wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third
floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, 
with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of 
them.

There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, 
everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City
Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage 
was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being
sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to 
get the things any cheaper.

I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in
his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we 
worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw 
me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his 
feelings, of course.

I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.
A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which
were protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen 
preventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press.

I thought the implication was that the prince destroyed one fourth of the
remaining Persian troops on the second round, and then 1/11 of those remaining
on the third round.  This would mean

Answer: a*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/4)*(1 - 1/11) = 280  -->  a = 821.333

Why retract your accusation that he's a liar?  If Omran retracts his "verbal
diarrohea" doesn't that only prove the liar he *really* is?  A retraction
would be pointless!  Giving this guy the opportunity to "save face" after
uttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again!  I must say

The donations are tax deductible like any donations to a non-profit
organization.  I've donated money to a group restoring streetcars
and it was tax deductible.  Why don't you contribute to a group

Celebrating in joy the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim 
people by your criminal grandparents between 1914 and 1920? Did you 
think that you could cover up the genocide perpetrated by your fascist

 "In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul.
  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic 
genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of 
annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

Is this the joke of the month? 

1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people
between 1914 and 1920.

2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the
European Jewry during WWII.

3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children

Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers 
(London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested 
the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the 
Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to 
deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his 
deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt 
obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history.
Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' 
or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger 
Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration 
as deplorable but insignificant.[1]

 Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately 
 forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi 
 collaboration.

 A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft
 is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The 
 magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany
 and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the
 magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,
 is attention-getting.

 This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
 important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be
 an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. 

 In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain
 political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They 
 occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.
 The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered 
 "Aryan" and what befell them.

Now wait, there is more.

I do (did) contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but when interest

	Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons.  They
include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the
fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the
historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.

	When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,
who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The
Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a
Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their
latrines.

	Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city.

	Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in
Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,
where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli
Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

Absolutely. I'm sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased
if the fighters (military, guerilla, whatever) would just take their
argument elsewhere, find an unpopulated area somewhere, and slug it out.  
At that point, we will all breath a sigh of relief *and* cheer for

Proven?  Maybe not.  But it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt.  This
statement and statements like it are a matter of public record.  Before the Six Day War (1967)
I think Nasser and some other Arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on
Arab radio.  You might want to check out some old newspapers Ahmed.

I think if you take a look at the Hamas covenant (written in 1988) you might get a 
different impression.  I have the convenant in the original arabic with a translation
that I've verified with Arabic speakers.  The document is rife with calls to kill jews
and spread Islam and so forth.

Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service 
to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known 
case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian 
agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission 
of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and 
to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied 
forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda 
efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among 
the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally
been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was
the center of international Armenian terrorism. 

In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish
genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret 
Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired
important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with
the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable 
source for the Germans.[2]

Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge
this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished 
of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only 
the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian 
Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of 
Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines 
genocide as acting with a 

  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a 
   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' 

History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate 
the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the 
Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including 
U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy 
as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of 
the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the 
extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor 
those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. 

The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,
beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian 
territories.

The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.
The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and
perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian 
Government.

The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were
Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,
Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

 were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part

It is called 'The Justice'. We also demand that the x-Soviet Armenian 
Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish 
Genocide, render reparations to the Muslim people, and return the 
land to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has 
become an issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative 
that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

Are you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF
Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? 

"If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the
nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have
opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. 
They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody "to worship in their own
way" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,
in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when 
people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs
differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the
inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and 
where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey
was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere
by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim
countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian
countries."[1]

"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came
under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It
was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of
Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a
Romanian nation today" (Popescu Ciocanel).

"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without
interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy
of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most
advanced European countries."[2]

"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw
is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples
of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account
of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of
simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into
action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves
happy!" (A. de Mortraye).[3]

"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the
inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate
victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that
in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and
Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been
living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,
and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the
cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to
appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,
however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,
local courts immediately take them under their protection."

"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are
living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and
the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is
more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition 
to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this 
sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the
dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional
candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in
the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical
processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing
their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them
which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of 
priests." (A. Ubicini).[4]

Not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte, who was _the_ UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of
independence.  He was killed by the Israelis.  Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war.

It wasn't all that long ago that the acts of Israeli soldiers were
described as "superhuman".  Now, they are "inhuman".  Did the Israelis
change so radically so quickly or have reporting attitudes changed?

When the Jews were powerless, they did what they could to help others,
which was obviously quite limited.  Later, liberated American Jews
were on the forefront of the civil-rights movement.  The Jewish
government of Israel rescued Jews ranging in skin color from White
Russian to Brown Yemenite to Black Ethiopian.  Please, Andi, tell us
"how the Jews are treating other races when they got power."

Your ignorance and bias are indeed unfortunate.

DEPOSITION OF LYUDMILA GRIGOREVNA M.

   Born 1959
   Teacher
   Sumgait Secondary School No. 10
   Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10
   Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office

   Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15
   Microdistrict No. 3
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

[Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in 
 Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights
 organizations - DD]

I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in
Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the
price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide
our lives into "before" and ''after." We talk like that: that was before the
war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole
epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,
it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even 
sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now
. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those
inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our
losses and everything that happened.

Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it
to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would
be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and 
those who didn't.

That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you 
could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was
near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as
my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. 
My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought
that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.

In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the
afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all
our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin
crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel
like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our 
apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in 
his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely 
locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a 
hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people 
who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends
of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.

My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my 
mother, "Run to the kitchen for a knife." But Mother was detached, pale, as 
though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never 
expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A 
girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, 
"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out 
of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment."

We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl 
crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and
Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that 
perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside 
me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to
embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina 
was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to 
say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. 
There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from
excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door
to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time
Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,
but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us 
immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at 
least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their 
eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst
in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They 
came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other 
room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma 
snatched the axe from behind and said, "Tell them not to touch the children. 
Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children." She
said this to Father in Armenian.

There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They 
understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, 
they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: "You and 
your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your 
children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, 
our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ," and 
so on and so forth, "and we came to do the same thing to you." This whole time
some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They 
were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people 
among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, 
all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm 
a teacher.

So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took 
him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,
because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all 
but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were 
doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off 
Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: "I'm old enough to 
be your mother! What are you doing?!" He struck her. Now he's being held, 
Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, 
who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying 
to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their 
consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they 
mustn't do it. She said, "Come on, let's straighten this out, without 
emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we 
ever do to you?" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come 
into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and 
coming--said, "What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We 
came here to kill them."

They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she 
didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, "What
did we do to you? What did we do to you?" And even later, when she came to, 
she said, "Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?"

That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only 
broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they 
were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain 
nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do 
was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they
did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, 
they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but 
didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they 
could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, 
kicking her, using anything they could find.

Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, 
just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they 
did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the
apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the 
corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, "Let's take her 
outside."

Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they 
weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time 
I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't 
afraid of what would happen to them.

When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered 
with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several 
times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though 
I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm 
vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold 
a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time 
I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, 
and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me 
"forget," you have to forget, you have to go on living.

At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and 
despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found
the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had
to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering 
to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that
he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me
and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over
me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that
they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up
with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a 
really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I 
suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly 
I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I 
just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the 
ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was 
still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,
they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with
their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-
cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.

I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. 
Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't 
need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had 
even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth 
living.

There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman 
pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come 
because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, 
and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to
put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The 
person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, 
because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he 
has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, 
one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, 
even during the investigation he almost called me "daughter," he apologized, 
although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that 
I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my 
words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,
but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never 
forget it.

I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one 
could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of 
beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.
I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.

And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a
couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to 
kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an 
end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into 
the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it 
was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was 
thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her 
and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all 
the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor 
from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a 
little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,
how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, 
"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,
I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I," he
says, "nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and 
think I never shall again." The door to his apartment was open and he saw 
everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken 
the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He 
saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven
people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the 
brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that 
they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to 
do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I

After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and 
Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even 
remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry "Marina!" out to her, but could
not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't
for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus
I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had
told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both
there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell 
right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that
she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad 
that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . 
although her spirit was murdered . . .

At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that 
mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his 
name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, "Igor,
help!" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were 
taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and 
Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the 
neighbors.

And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, 
something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.
 
Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, 
they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out 
onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already 
sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone 
said, "She's already dead, let's throw her out." When they carried me out onto
the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I 
heard someone say in Azerbaijani: "Don't kill her, I know her, she's a 
teacher." I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember
whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an 
accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks
Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and
threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	I having opened my 
eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had 
been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only 
remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately 
I can't remember anything more.

What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot 
about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too
much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that 
women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,
if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated
very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in 
Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that 
all out later.

Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary 
of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is 
Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,
she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she 
didn't want to endanger him. She said, "He was there," and a little while 
later, "Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. 
No, it seems like it was he." I am sure it was he because when he came to see 
us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something 
entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see
us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought 
groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started 
crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting 
us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned 
him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. 
The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is 
right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the 
investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was
told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone 
to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.

Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she 
bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her 
wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's 
lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A 
Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by
his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a 
special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm 
a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that
boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, 
and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. 
After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.

He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, "Lady, if you give us all the gold 
and money in your apartment we'll let you live." And Mamma told them where 
the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and 
everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other 
over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one 
another right then.

Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was
black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she 
ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his
mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-
low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, 
halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, 
and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, 
it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.

The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father 
out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,
a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people 
were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, 
everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee
service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, "I was afraid 
to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the 
threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and 
dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'." Mamma remembered one of the 
criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, 
out of one eye. She says, "I realized that my death would come from that 
person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing."
Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.

I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina 
was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all
alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even
though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and
Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.
I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. 
But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones 
I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the 
ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and 
that all of that would die with me.

At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I 
didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that
we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, "Neighbor, is that
you?" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived
I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been 
taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to 
take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he
had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he 
started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. 
The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in 
the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the 
presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities 
or not. He said, "Enough, let's go to the third entryway." In the third 
entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once 
again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as 
they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they 
found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had 
already taken the other.

Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They
had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over
those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I 
identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an 
Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:
"Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here."
That's just what he said, "those Azerbaijanis," as though he himself were not 
Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, "I'll drive
them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails
and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41." 
That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the 
person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened 
to, the "general," said that they were going to the third entryway.

Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. 
Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I
was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. 
He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. 
But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.

I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt 
from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find 
anything. He told me, "Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the 
neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're 
alive." He told me all this in Armenian.

Then he returned to the others and said, "What are you waiting for? Leave!" 
They said, "Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her 
yourself. No, we want to do it to." He urged them on, but gently, not 
coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just
boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went
down to the third floor with them himself, and said, "Leave. What's the mat-
ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?" And
he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that 
he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I 
told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really
good terms with them.

We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman 
opened the door and immediately said, "I'm an Azerbaijani." He said, "I know. 
Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows
about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place." She says, "Fine,
have her come in." I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I 
had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into 
tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a 
half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, "Do you know where my family 
is, what happened to them?" She says, "No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid 
to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see 
who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian." Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my 
neighbor says, "You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, 
or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else." During the butchery in our
apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl
earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was 
still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I 
touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it
to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.

I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I 
don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I 
end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the 
apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. 
I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had 
hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near 
some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. 
Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I 
think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were
broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay 
there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town 
could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were 
burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started
picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport 
jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the
one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. 
And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to 
strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on 
my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me
afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got 
burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was
protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know 
how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if 
I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I 
had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on 
living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I 
thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. 
I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in 
Afghanistan, he should protect her.

While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I
thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would 
she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among 
themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no
children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. 
Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good 
job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was 
all over. They started to argue. A third one says, "How come you get it? I 
have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. 
All these years I've been living in God-awful places." Another one says, 
"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave." Then someone said 
that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their
place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and
left.

Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite 
frequently, "Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let 
them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians." Then they 
said, "Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!" They repeated it 
very often.

Avi,
   For your information, Islam permits freedom of religion - there is
no compulsion in religion.  Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
(i.e. are non-Jews recognized in Judaism).  Just wondering.

And anyone who doesn't agree with you is, by your own definitions, a
"useless fart".  Just like any text that disputes your own "findings"
is always described as "flawed" or "biased".  In other words, you
trumpet the things you like and dismiss those that might embarass you.
We've seen you play these games here for a long time.

One thing is for sure: When it comes to "useless farts", you sure know 
what you're talking about.

That's why the Zionists decided that Zion must be Gentile-rein.

Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion
where they were both part of the same "mandate territory" - read
colony.

Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another

all wars of aggression have started.

The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every

So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and 
a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation
because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the
Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.

They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return
of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the
Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud
beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous
population.

The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the 
redefinition of much land used in common as "public land". The assertion
that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to
an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an
excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought
in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the
Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories
must not be changed. 

No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists
will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of
those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.

Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.

If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have
cut the money supply.

The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country

Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.
Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.


The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the
Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it
is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the
return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the
dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against
non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. 

The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has
a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the
Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean
outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying
or using much of the land.

Oh, why do you expose your ignorance?  The US has been running on debt for 
the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases.

And after the Gulf War, Israel could do whatever it wanted after
not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks.  It was encouraged, but
by no means forced, to negotiate.

Mr. Baker, to address all of your points would be impossible, but in a 
nutshell, it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in
Lebanon without attacking Syria.  Syrian occupation has been hostile,
and amounts to annexation.  Israel's is clearly defensive.  If it 
were not defensive, you would see all of Lebanon occupied, and governed by
Israel.  But that is not what Israel wants.

This was true (and I may add the adjective "stupid") until the Intifada.
Since then, no serious Israeli leader (including Shamir) really thinks
the the occupied territories worth the trouble. The only question became
the question of price and other quantitative detail. The best thing the 
Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifada
and try to live as normally as possible (I know, it's hard under occupation).
Otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing (as justified
as it may be) has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that 
prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes. Currently 
it serves no purpose and it's just a waste of human life and economic
resources.

Your suggestion to learn something about "the perversion of Judaism"
from someone you claim has experience in Israeli intelligence and the
PLO is like a suggestion to learn something about the conspiracy of

	There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is

	This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection:

	- it is all in Arens' mind.
	- Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO
	- Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense 
Minister) was spying on him.
	- Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.

	In any case, who cares?

Steve,

If the Israelis are stupid enough to "allow" a second "Palestinian"
state (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your
wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

However, if the "Palestinians" were to somehow demonstrate that 
they could govern themselves AND live in peace with their 
Jewish neighbors, then they would have to give up the idea of
Jerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.

I lived there until July 1992 so I think that on the whole,
my input is relevant.

Those are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do
recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports,
consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality
which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field
is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments
of the gov't, though this is not the general case.

|> 2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders

From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both
war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining
its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have
been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for "ultimate borders"
(is this a game like "ultimate frisbee"?) extending into  other countries.

Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.

If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is
unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron.
That having been said, I deny the above.

You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious
bias.  Questions of the sort "Is it true that you entered your
mother's vagina?" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though
phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions
upon Israel.  Incidentally, the answer to the above is usually yes,
unless you were born via a C-section.

	And Lebanon has a right to make this decision without Syrian

	They lasted weeks against tanks in '48, and stopped those
tanks from advancing.  They also lasted days in '73.  There is little
evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.

	They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take
place over the Jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled
kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are
usually picked up in the morning.

Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things
Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those
who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their
claim, and (2) those who lose.

Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen
cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.
Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that
an individual has to file a return.

Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer
for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and
so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.

Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a
claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with
the tax code.

I can only say that those people are wrong. The word harass means to 
irritate or torment persistently; I'd hardly consider one time to fall
under the definition of persistent.  Additionally, there is no basis
to assume the behaviour is unwanted, unlike an illegal proposition.

I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint.  What you say is true, but
the law, in order to make what little sense it manages to make, has to
make *some* assumptions.  Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted
by the average citizen I think is reasonable.  Certainly, I would need
a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there
was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome.

The number of people who participate in "victimless" crimes notwithstanding,
the fact reamins that under the law, the activity is illegal.  To presume
that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people
indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in
with a straight face.

Sorry, but I don't see how the response applies to what was posted.

Unless I am badly mistaken, Rohit is suggesting that protecting boys
from men is different than protecting girls from men. There are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the *opposite* sex
(due to social convention or whatever) and thus are safe (in at least
some sense). These same situations don't (necessarily) protect the
children from abuse by members of the *same* sex.

If we can understand that, it's not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard, *someone* may come up with a
practical solution (or even a partial solution) to some of the situations
in which children are made vulnerable to homosexuals who wish to abuse
them. By working together "with good will on both sides", we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone's freedoms.

Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit's post as an excuse for
personal attacks on Mr. Cramer. While Mr. Walz hasn't (by a *long*
stretch) been the only one to flame Mr. Cramer, it is no less childish
and it only serves to weaken any other arguments he may make in the
future.

Yet, when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this 
philosophy to cigarette smokers (so that people who smoked away
from the work couldn't be discriminated against by employers),
the liberal Gov. Wilder vetoed it.  Which shows that liberals don't
give a damn about "best person for the job," it's just a power
play.

And of course, in states like Kentucky and Virginia, not well-suited to
large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most 
valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  In some ways, this
treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying

This is an interesting question.  Steinbeck's _Grapes of Wrath_
(published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton
production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted
from the land.  How many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming?  When did this first appear?

Maybe we should ask the 83,103 people who were laid off this January whether
or not we're in a recession. That was a figure that was reported in the
New York Times. There is no official figure, because the Bureau of Labor
Statistics stopped government tracking of layoffs eight months ago due to
budget cuts.

Maybe because the claims deserve refute?  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung
problems.  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but 
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered 
their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  I'm going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow.

What justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  Research?  What sort of 
research?  Correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not
prove anything.

>How can you expect someone to make a

Heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants.  There are side effects, like withdrawal, but they
effect people differently.  

>I've seen numerous

Stereotypical statement.  I know people who use heroin and opiates that 
function just fine in society.  

>This group does

Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.

NO, NO, NO.  (or at least I haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis
is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they
are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,
and that makes them stronger.  

>I think it's time y'all re-examined

the hell I can't!  they state *UN-JUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS* *AS FACT* as
a *POLITICAL* strategy to stop drug use.

[...]

In general, I somewhat see what you're saying.  And people like Jack Herer
contribute to this.  This has been quite a big mind-fuck for me recently,
and I've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust _ANYBODY_ by
word of mouth alone -- my attitude about the general population has
decreased significantly.  

gotta run to class..

                PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS
	     
                           Canada Place
                   Vancouver, British Columbia



2:46 P.M. PDT

	     	  
	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you 
could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll 
give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the 
Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government 
money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the 
government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going 
to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian 
businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What 
are the priorities, because there are several association of 
Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to 
participate in setting up priorities for investment?  
	     
	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know 
that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans 
are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls 
say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times 
published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 
42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent 
if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to 
sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not 
very enthusiastic?  Thank you.
	     
	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going 
to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the 
answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, 
it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, 
the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will 
obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be 
good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will 
be used to support the privatization of existing public 
enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the 
Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have 
some influence over the distribution of.  
	     
	     With regard to your second question, let me say that 
I would think that there would be people in both countries who 
would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government 
giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to 
that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history 
there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That 
is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole 
history of America, any kind of aid program has always been 
unpopular.  
	     
	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is 
this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that 
this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --
trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments 
because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in 
Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them 
working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies 
going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it 
possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the 
economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and 
investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce 
nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on 
our side and on the Russian side.  
	     
	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an 
investment for the United States.  This is very much in the 
interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the 
second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next 
week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for 
the taxpayers and workers of my country.  
	     
	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some 
partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share 
her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view 
this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not 
what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful 
investment.  
	     
	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But 
there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than 
the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier 
of the Cold War.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very 
much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory 
of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American 
President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind 
of a very measured breakthrough.  
	     
	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory 
remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief 
that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you 
tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to 
what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification 
of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how 
confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager 
to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions 
inherited from the Cold War?  
	     
	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of 
Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with 
regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent 
states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States 
develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing 
that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of 
the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude 
our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that 
would provide not only an important economic opportunity for 
Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out 
on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed 
off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and 
we agreed to continue to press that.
	     
	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to 
reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the 
Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the 
United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, 
but that, in order to do what we need to do together to 
strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States 
be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join 
the NPT regime is critical.
	     
	     What was the second question?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and 
COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the 
Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, 
as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other 
restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on 
relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies 
of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of 
them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the 
leadership of the Congress.
	     
	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be 
an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there 
are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to 
emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there 
is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed 
to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be 
much less.
	     
	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing 
more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my 
own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement 
out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to 
begin it in the fairly near future.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in 
Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely 
different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not 
political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of 
Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the 
difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the 
difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of 
Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the 
last part of your speech?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to 
compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say 
what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a 
boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the 
music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been 
thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music 
for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists 
and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know 
as much as I could about your history.  
	     
	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then 
the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last 
presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone 
in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. 
Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I 
was following events there very closely and hoping for the day 
when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a 
personal feeling about Russia.  
	     
	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like 
music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a 
musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York 
Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony 
to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly 
than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically 
so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it 
occurred.  
	     
	     These are things that have always had a big impact 
on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever 
had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two 
countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


 10:10 A.M. EDT
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is soon 
to be on his way, on Amtrack to Camden Yards.  He'll be throwing out 
the first pitch.
	     
	     Q	  It's MARC, the Maryland Area Transit, it's not 
Amtrack.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, it's not Amtrack?  Well, he's 
going from Union Station, you're right.  Excuse me.
	     
	     Q	  George, what exactly are you prepared to do to 
break the logjam with  ??? Senate?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, there are 
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning, 
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point 
that he believes that our investment package, our jobs package needs 
to be passed as quickly as possible.  We need this investment for 
summer jobs, for immunization, for highway construction, for the 
important programs that will put people back to work right away this 
summer.  And the President continues to believe his program should be 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  Will he compromise, that's the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the discussions 
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and 
Senator Dole, let's see what they come up with.  But the President 
believes his jobs program should go forward.
	     
	     Q	  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 
billion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise 
being offered by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being 
offered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right 
now, let's see what happens today.
	     
	     Q	  Would he go that far -- no matter what the 
Republicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per 
year?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his 
program should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be 
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to 
come up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's 
see what happens.
	     
	     Q	  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has 
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order 
to get a vote?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more 
intrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in 
doing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the 
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the 
President's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, 
real jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no 
question about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative 
activity over the last few days.
	     
	     Q	  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the 
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.
	     
	     Q	     prepared to compromise --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen 
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting 
with Senator Dole. 
	     
	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's 
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term.
	     
	     Q	  How?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record 
time, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by 
$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for 
important investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong 
passage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a 
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock 
and hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that 
he is not succeeding overall.
	     
	     Q	  He can't beat this, can he?
	     
	     Q	  The fact is they can do that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop 
action.  There's no question about that.
	     
	     Q	  What are you going to do about it?
	     
	     Q	  George, what do you know about these alleged notes 
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears 
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that 
when they say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete 
misreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the 
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring 
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime 
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's 
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and 
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where 
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese 
were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when 
the Japanese say yes they mean no?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the 
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say 
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime 
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.
	     
	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the 
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and 
there appears to be --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the 
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It 
does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of 
view.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that 
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up 
but I'm not positive.
	     
	     Q	  George, was the specific comment that was made 
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general 
observation on Japanese etiquette?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --
	     
	     Q	  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that 
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, "when the 
Japanese say yes they mean no."
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean 
I don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific 
comment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific 
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that 
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.
	     
	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual 
observation.
	     
	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to 
clear it up.  Has the President sent a message?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President 
spoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but 
I'm not sure exactly how many.
	     
	     Q	  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're 
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got 
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that 
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the 
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure 
there is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is 
on.
	     
	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they 
may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese 
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two 
days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime 
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. 
position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the 
Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's 
commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a 
constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to 
hear that.
	     
	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq 
for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. 
policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary 
Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have 
reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance 
with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.
	     
	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, 
Saddam can't stay in office?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our 
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with 
the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that 
we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will 
continue to demand it.
	     
	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the 
dominant power in the area --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also 
spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect 
full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping 
support of terrorism.
	     
	     Q	  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in 
power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you 
base that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not 
complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the 
rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is 
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding 
armaments.
	     
	     Q	  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he 
would be out of power?

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on 
the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make 
it more difficult for him to stay in power.
	     
	     Q	  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it 
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure 
politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence 
do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical 
difference with you that's in good faith?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times 
in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the 
fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now 
seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  
	     
	     Q	  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate 
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to 
them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had 
one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate 
Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and 
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -
-
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true 
that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the 
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the 
introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate 
Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are 
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who 
have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in 
what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is 
important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.
	     
	     Q	     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats 
alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it 
through?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is 
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can 
frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  
You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going 
and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.
	     
	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get 
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of 
the summer?
	     
	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some 
Republicans into your camp?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to 
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the 
President's intiatives?
	     
	     Q	  But on this one -- how are you going to do it 
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you 
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear 
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and 
could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for 
particular votes?  When you have to go through --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and 
understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the 
President's going to continue to reach out when he can.
	     
	     Q	  You don't have any regrets then about the way you 
have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your 
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this 
experience?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like 
his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue 
to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, 
there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with 
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this 
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around 
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.
	     
	     Q	  They're being denied any other legislative means of 
putting their proposals forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --
	     
	     Q	     any ideas.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being 
defeated; I don't know that they're being denied.
	     
	     Q	     to present them.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean 
they get the votes --
	     
	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the 
parliamentary rules under which they're playing.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in 
support all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.
	     
	     Q	  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration 
backing any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?
	     
	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for 
Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of 
grooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at 
some levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about 
anything recently.
	     
	     Q	     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the 
President's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be 
some kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the 
President, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider 
something like that, or any other kind of intervention there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President 
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a 
special envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around 
the California economic situation, including the situation in Los 
Angeles.  
	     
	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles 
by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, 
Mr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD 
Secretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits 
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I 
wouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to 
California.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is 
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy 
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities 
which help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to 
watch it.
	     
	     Q	  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also 
supposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a 
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball 
management.  Does the President have a position on that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received 
correspondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson 
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  
He clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in 
baseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the 
President intends to continue to go to the ball game.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see 
Reverend Jackson while he's out there?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see 
them, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has 
raised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, 
even though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.
	     
	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball 
game?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe 
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an 
informational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to 
the ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining 
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the 
President read it.
	     
	     Q	  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the 
managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be 
there, and is he going to meet with the President?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is 
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a 
lunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice 
President Gore.
	     
	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, 
yes.
	     
	     Q	  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did 
warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist 
activities?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, 
I mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been 
general conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a 
long period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I 
mean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there 
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  
The President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also 
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.
	     
	     Q	  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, 
apparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, 
forgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at 
the moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in 
their attempts to get some kind of action.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would 
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did 
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a 
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate 
action.  But there was no specific information on this specific 
operation at all.
	     
	     Q	  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the 
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have 
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in 
not pursuing some kind of --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.
	     
	     Q	  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing 
mention in the news conference yesterday --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your 
question.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted 
action between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what 
does the U.S. do next?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going 
to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our 
allies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways 
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an 
agreement.
	     
	     Q	  George, why do you think sanctions is still an 
option?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the 
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait 
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day 
said there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any 
time soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When 
does no mean no and you have to do something different?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something 
different.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the 
U.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to 
try and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every 
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.
	     
	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? 
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something 
that is under consideration.
	     
	     Q	  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's 
condition, how he's doing?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.
	     
	     Q	  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think 
we'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning 
after the Mubarak visit.
	     
	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid 
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with 
the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their 
delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the 
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the 
next several weeks.
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude 
of the one announced Sunday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the 
magnitude.
	     
	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where 
do you stand on that --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, 
he's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week 
and reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this 
week and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a 
hard look at it.
	     
	     Q	  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White 
House involvement, Congress is compiling this list?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the 
congressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll 
be able to get our own researchers working as well.
	     
	     Q	  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a 
probability than a possibility?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under 
discussion.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter 
of time and -- for months before that happens.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's 
something that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working 
with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll 
continue to review other matters.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule 
this week?  Any travel?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I 
don't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right 
now.
	     
	     Q	  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish 
American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference 
of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National 
Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  
We'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate 
discussions.
	     
	     Thanks.

Hmmm.  Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means
third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting
a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 
21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are
wrong.

By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally 
stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law, 
but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was
terribly upset about this.

I remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
doesn't have a grain of truth to it.

If a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will
do it again and it may be funny. Then they may repeat it over and over
again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any
more. Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing
the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.

Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. He does not
make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule
their target. Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put
on a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the
spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the
user couldn't think of anything original to say.


In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner
guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns. Ed is clearly one
of this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent.

Note that the laws that don't agree with you were passed to protect
a class of people who couldn't get justice from the state courts;
specifically civil rights workers in Missisippi in the 60's. The 
federal protection of individual rights supersedes the non-feasance
of the state. Something similar has long been traditional ( well
he's queer so I beat him up...) for gays

As Anatole France said; "The law in its impartial majesty forbids the
rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges."

Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways. For example
the fact that all property thefts, regardless of value, are not
punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have
a lot of money from having it stolen. You could easily define
equality to regard the property in terms of it's significance
for the owner. This would a form of equality that would be skewed
toward poorer people.

In fact, most anti-gay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal 
protection. They make it an offense to damage people based on a 
motivation of hatred for sexual orientation. Thus the law in its
impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed.
I'm sure that's a great relief to Douglas Meier.

To answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,
but I still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
merely begged the question without responding.  By trying to inject
the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could
be "Is a polydactyl person a human being?"  You still have not
answered what you mean by human being.  Please do so.

You won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.
If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,
provide it for me.

More irrelevancies.  As Larry Margolis pointed out, the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does
not follow your version of human being.  And as he pointed out,
brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant
difference.

What I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started?  You got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,
changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,
why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations, e.g. "It really doesn't matter to you..."
If it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek
some substance?  You're not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words.

As others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy
fails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.
A woman's womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?

You simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on
for size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.
But the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The
systems are dependent on each other for life.  I'm still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.

Your argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total
failure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in
reality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,
that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,
you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than
a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,
there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman's womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to
its claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?

You haven't answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.

Again you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and
it is not as slow as you seem to think.

Yes, and I'd hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn's children that
he was murdered by a religious, "pro-life" fanatic.  Please do

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?
Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  What
is different about the two situations?  I see I have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  In the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake.  You can't have it both ways.  Action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a
healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as
she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at
parties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and
the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.

   Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation I've posted.
   Teel, it's bad enough you post this bs, it's even worse that you don't
   even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting
   that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
   contrary point to a severely deluded mind.

What I found interesting about Conklin's letter is the 
6 cases he has won against the IRS.  Now, assuming that
these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?)
they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  The IRS fought
one of his deductions.   Defending your deductions seems puny when
you believe that there is no need to file in the first place!

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary.
Price controls and government intervention.  The surest route to
disaster.  It's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or
common sense).  Price controls do not, and cannot work.  I would have
thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to 
dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  As for
government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what
the are saying.  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  We are presented with
horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.
We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about
how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that
should come as any surprise).  And yet, people choose to ignore all
of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to
the rescue.  Simply amazing.

Yea, it turned out that Gramm-Rudman was a sham to fool the voters

Anyone can expand the economy by chargeing $3 trillion on their credit
cards.   Big deal.  Deficit spending only expands the economy in the short
term.  In the long term it shrinks the economy for numerous reasons. I would 
have MUCH preferred that the taxpayers had that $3 trillion instead.

If Reagan had kept his campaign PROMISE to balance the budget by 1983,
there would have been no need for Bush or Clinton to raise taxes.  And
all Reagan had to do was balance that puny Carter deficit.

Chew on that awhile.

Jobs?  What the hell have jobs to do with it?  It's another touchy-feely 
program from the new, vapid administration.  The fact is, the major claim
made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" --
has absolutely no validity.  Several states already have U.I. programs, have
had these programs for _years_. The result: on average, their success rates
are no better than the national average.  It seems that the gummint hasn't
yet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in.  Yet another case

All together now... c'mon, you know the words... "Meet the new boss! Same as

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of
the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,
the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.

Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing
us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It
is not "produced": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for
example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an
earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.

: arrange their affairs.

The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often
freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and
clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their
Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared
many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, "hi'ipoi", the Hawaiian
word for "cherish" means "sharing food".  The Great Mahele, in which
the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and
the poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will often
share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village
and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to
Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-
called "theft" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,
until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

These are the people we call "savages".

On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.

Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it would
behoove you to study *all* of the facts.

You asked a question, and now you don't want people to answer?  I believe
a legitimate question was asked.  Why shouldn't cost and safety be used
(at least in part) to determine legality?

I'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea.
Seems to me the evidence from Great Britain is pretty convincing that 
drug legalization is a good idea.  Even such a noted conservative as
William F. Buckley supports it.

Your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria
(safer AND cheaper).  Obviously, killing people is not "safe".  As for
prostitution, why shouldn't it be legal?

For Immediate Release                             April 14, 1993     

	     
                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AT SUMMER JOBS CONFERENCE

	     	  
                            Hyatt Regency
                        Crystal City, Virginia  


11:22 A.M. EDT

	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that 
Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today 
about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to 
get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature 
of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of 
people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of 
those who are here.  
	     
	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education 
and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my 
good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and 
all of the business and local community leaders from the city and 
county and state level from around America who are here. 
	     
	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved 
hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is 
their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A 
year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because 
I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our 
country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had 
too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines 
of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to 
take us into the future.  
	     
	     I entered with the hope that together we could create 
more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of 
our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of 
America's community, knowing that together we could always to more 
than we could individually and that we might secure our future.
	     
	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 
jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the 
commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, 
and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs 
does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this 
stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all 
those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're 
on the right track.
	     
	     Last July when I was traveling across America's 
heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in 
Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business 
people who were participating in the Louisville Education and 
Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  
I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed 
both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my 
own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about 
-- that for millions of American young people it is really an 
impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good 
workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what 
is learning.
	     
	     In the world in which we are living, the average young 
person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a 
lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning 
world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young 
people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased 
here today.  
	     
	     Whether you're in business or in government or in 
education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to 
building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all 
of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things 
are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best 
thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have 
jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  
	     
	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty 
good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that 
they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either 
political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great 
challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to 
fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work 
for them to do.
	     
	     All the European countries have higher unemployment 
rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the 
unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  
They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its 
most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that 
I have proposed to create jobs. 
	     
	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now 
about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  
It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of 
pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing 
their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their 
people.  
	     
	     But it is especially important for America for two 
reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move 
aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be 
competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, 
even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed 
of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to 
work in this country.  (Applause.)
	     
	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some 
of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and 
moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We 
have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big 
organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they 
are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working 
at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to 
create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the 
chance to work.  
	     
	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare 
reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of 
months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the 
end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of 
the American people to perform without regard to race or income or 
the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that 
there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their 
talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  
I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if 
you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more 
responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this 
country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you 
have got to have opportunity in that mix. 
	     
	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for 
every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules 
and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be 
something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are 
basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, 
recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of 
our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their 
background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's 
something there for them to do?

	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an 
integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of 
work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people 
first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private 
sector.
	     
	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in 
February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 
extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the 
American business community to meet that target so that we can create  
more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been 
created before.
	     
	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And 
Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in 
this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more 
than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people 
a work experience.  And it is terribly important.
	     
	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is 
part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the 
American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their 
jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving 
the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to 
college but do need at least two years of post-high school training 
either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, 
so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more 
people to go on to college who do want to go.
	     
	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive 
plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The 
emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would 
create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and 
that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It 
would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work 
force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.
	     
	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to 
invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --
projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, 
new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities 
-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve 
the environment.  
	     
	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that 
because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the 
Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching 
out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer 
jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to 
hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young 
people into further educational opportunities and to further job 
opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component 
to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government 
has never fully emphasized before.  
	     
	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because 
they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in 
difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building 
their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other 
areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who 
have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what 
they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next 
year.  
	     
	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the 
opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning 
skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next 
couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school 
in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning 
environment.  
	     
	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities 
for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this 
will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will 
be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new 
work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.
	     
	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-
work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding 
the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help 
to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve 
local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public 
buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in 
hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, 
and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while 
they earn, but letting them earn.
	     
	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people 
who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should 
do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the 
opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing 
in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't 
exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare 
system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people 
to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the 
use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if 
you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to 
reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     The young people we propose to put to work under our 
program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, 
reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will 
stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a 
sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, 
but a challenge that will take them into a different life.
	     
	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even 
as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the 
summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll 
see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer 
academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved 
ahead.  I suspect that they will.  
	     
	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I 
will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn 
from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next 
summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school 
year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that 
we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so 
that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private 
investments as well. 
	     
	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the 
business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this 
summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business 
who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who 
haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about 
this event today, I want to implore other private employers to 
stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this 
summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when 
we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort 
them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)
	     
	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up 
here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking 
about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've 
done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very 
foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand 
and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had 
ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be 
worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     That does not mean young people should not be 
entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation 
ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and 
worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  
And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some 
people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  
	     
	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I 
grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul 
without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a 
job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to 
people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a 
job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now 
I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any 
more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're 
working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  
And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these 
young people want.
	     
	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  
It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration 
pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private 
sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn 
how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created 
in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done 
off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a 
third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do 
economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of 
America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just 
kidding.  
	     
	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy 
country in the world, including the United States, is having 
difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done 
I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole 
deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the 
answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  
(Applause.)
	     
	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to 
Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the 
counties, through the Community Development Program, with the 
infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an 
attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the 
economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little 
boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a 
million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.
	     
	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in 
the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government 
money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American 
economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind 
of system we have and it works pretty well.  
	     
	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you 
here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends 
and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers 
to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the 
funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government 
should create this summer, so that together we can have this 
partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a 
future -- a future that our young people can believe in.  
	     
	     We need to send them a message that here in America if 
you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute 
something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  
You can build a future from you own dreams. 
	     
	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together 
that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of 
the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise 
has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.
	     
	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

                                 END11:45 A.M. EDT

Yes, I have!  Wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land
from South Africa up to Egypt across to the congo?  If my memory serves
me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he
wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.

He died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.

Good thing too as he had designs on Europe, America (north and south),
and the Falkland Islands.

This is similar to my saying that Clinton's timber summit does little to
fix the health care problem.  Look at the whole picture, not just
randomly picked libertarian positions.  If government is not allowed to
use "non-initiated force" to achieve its goals, than no special interest
can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which I'll address briefly.  It certainly won't happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  Statists run the education
monopoly, so we have to be creative.  The Advocates for Self-Government
reports 85% of their Seminar 1 participants "embrace" libertarianism.
That's the best means I've seen yet.  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]

It's amazing to me that governments around the world will try every
aspect of government control before, as a final last resort after
everything else fails, they will try individual liberty.

Since the actual verdicts were not known by the authorities, it was
smart not to allow "Friday night for fighting" (sorry, Elton) and to
seal them for this morning.  Also, it allows for maximum daylight to
wear down and frustrate any potential troublemakers, as well as give
more preparation time.

Actually, that was 8 PM 'cos it was shown live on our 11 PM news
and cut into CNN's 11 O'clock Sports (sorry, but I didn't watch
the Devils-Islanders game!  No SportsChannel ...).

We had cutovers to LA's KNBC on our WNBC, and I didn't recall this
detail.  But I'll not comment further on that ...

A net-contact in L.A. tells me that the alert will remain over this
weekend, as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts
on three of five charges (the aiding-and-abetting).  Those acquittals
seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind
of angel that night, speeding and fleeing et al.  However ...  Another
consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on
the excessive force charges (Koons for incompetance, and Powell for
overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops
interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  Also, some elements
may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb
move, obviously).  And, Koreans are still scared and certain people
are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year.

A Commander from Nassau, Long Island was questioned about how his
people would have handled Rodney King, and he said "We'd have let
him roll around in the dirt 'til he got tired, then handcuff him".

Uh, well, Golly Gee Whiz. Let me see, when the new President, as his first

military, despite polls showing a consistent 75%+ against it, and the
minority is only 1%, well, gee, I sure think that is newsworthy.

Hmm, you still don't get it. Then again, I'm not posting from a  University

Tell me, committed any anti-semitic acts today? What kind of boots do you

And still -- Libertarians want the State out of their lives. Parents are very
capable of protecting their children against the predations of pedophiles,
which, BTW, you still haven't disassociated yourself from.

have any idea why this country still exists after 200+ years.

Sigh.  It's so amusing to watch bigots point fingers at what they imagine to
be other bigots.  I do believe this person meant "bean *counting*".  And are
you trying to suggest that only Hispanics eat beans?  Or that they even have
a monopoly on eating beans?  Or that this person is seriously promoting what
is obviously a tongue-in-cheek .sig?

You must have a brain somewhere, if you can cause your fingers to type.  Use
it.

                    INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT
                      BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF
                    KDKA-AM RADIO, PITTSBURGH
	     
                 Pittsburgh International Airport
                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania    



10:40 A.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike 
Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh 
International Airport and with me is the President of the United 
States Bill Clinton.
	     
	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.
	     
	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk 
about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just 
breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been 
kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in 
the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard 
that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and 
Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been 
found not guilty.
	     
	     It's a situation that's been building for over a 
year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  
And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see 
the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your 
administration and what you're trying to do.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the 
American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a 
tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the 
efforts of the federal government in developing the case.
	     
	     The law under which the officers were tried is a 
complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury 
decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible 
for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did 
most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked 
Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some 
blows, and another officer who was a rookie.
	     
	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but 
it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They 
acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think 
that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But 
I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  
first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country 
together and not violate the civil rights of any American; 
secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  
	     
	     I think it's important to recognize that in the 
poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this 
country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're 
even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our 
efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police 
officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a 
waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some 
other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to 
violence and drugs.
	     
	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to 
me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic 
revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed 
areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles 
who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many 
problems as we do.  
	     
	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the 
campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment 
to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, 
Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies 
for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest 
unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the 
country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to 
the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several 
other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with 
regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.
	     
	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the 
Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a 
lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  
You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you 
said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break 
that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to 
Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that 
battle?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First 
of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported 
me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in 
economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it 
gives the country a very different budget for the next five years 
than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, 
at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and 
health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.
	     
	     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the 
short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money 
to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; 
to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also 
to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The 
plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the 
Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a 
bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come 
to a vote.
	     
	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote 
for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican 
leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to 
stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases 
the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending 
targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for 
this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five 
years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the 
economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that 
are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for 
billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --
much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.
	     
	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  
I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I 
think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work 
right now to show that we're changing the direction of the 
country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.
	     
	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or 
his office lately?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk 
regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison 
operation to the senators that we think are open to this --
Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords 
from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six 
others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and 
know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life 
of the budget I presented.
	     
	     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've 
got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth 
is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life 
of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we 
have this program well below the spending targets that Congress 
has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for 
years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans 
voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as 
putting the American people back to work.  
	     
	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political 
issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and 
the need for jobs.
	     
	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported 
you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  
It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot 
of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I 
think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the 
White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go 
through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And 
they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull 
it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew 
it was going to be like this.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask 
people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving 
very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the 
fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in 
history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we 
are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on 
political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole 
wide range of things.  
	     
	     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn 
it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions 
which led to the victory I received from the people in November, 
and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making 
real, real progress.  
	     
	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  
We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going 
to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing 
things.
	     
	     Q	  Thank you very much.  
	     
	     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, 
here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, 
KDKA News.

                  RADIO ADDRESS TO THE NATION

10:06 A.M. EDT
             
             
             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to
you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio
station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to
meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,
health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly
broadcast with the American people. 
             
             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when
it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past
seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with
the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus
tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last
year's campaign.
             
             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with
you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and
what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting
to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.
             
             You sent me to Washington to get our government and
economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad
experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important
it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do
business.  
             
             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations
rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness
of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the
cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,
labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the
industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've
made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which
our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them
have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been
falling behind.
             
             We have an economy today that even when it grows is
not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation
by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to
show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have
stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks
and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating
cost of health care.
             
             But we also know that, given the right tools, the
right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and
businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy
needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better
places to live.
             
             In many critical products today Americans are the
low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that
we create more of those kinds of jobs.
             
             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for
long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old
priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to
be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs
and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the
waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious
resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the
groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.
             
             These new directions passed the Congress in record
time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our
country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would
create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private
sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It
now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. 
But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the
Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know
would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.
             
             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. 
Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and
counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill
has been grounded by gridlock.  
             
             I know the American people are tired of business as
usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin
or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have
taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra
mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25
percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  
             
             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million
Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill
languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean
hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to
act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking
this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I
think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant
portion of our original goals.
             
             First, we want to keep the programs as much as
possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,
including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young
people, immunization for children, construction of waste water
sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding
for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who
have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't
creating jobs.
             
             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs
in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40
percent.
             
             And third, I've recommended a new element in this
program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against
crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire
police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put
them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight
for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it
and deserve it.
             
             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --
the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it
increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this
year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,
doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more
than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this
budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the
Congress this year.
             
             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators
who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous
administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of
emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the
American people to work.  
             
             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered
a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities
are -- on people or on politics.  
             
             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar
for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the
soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our
children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs
and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of
us when we've helped make more American partners working to
ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.
             
             You know, if every American who wanted a job had
one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this
country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first
step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country
again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid
for over the life of our budget.
             
             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how
important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.
             
             Good morning, and thank you for listening.

                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT

It is a bit unfair to call blame the Clinton Administration alone...this

And the religious right worships engines, smokestacks, landfills,

What does this name-calling have to do with anything you are claiming about
the truth of environmental disaster?  Nothing that I have read in this
thread, nor heard from anyone I have talked to, would suggest to me that 
people fit the definition you give of the religious left.  Come off it, Phil.
A prime motivation for protecting our environment is so that we, 
people, can continue to live in it healthily.  We just disagree on what
is necessary to maintaining a healthy environment FOR PEOPLE.

Not a problem?  Would you move to Three Mile Island?  I would imagine 
there is some cheap property available!  

The naturally occurring catastrophic events [disasters] that destroy 
property (ie: hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes) do not usually leave 
toxic wastes that prevent people from re-building their lives there.  
The man-made disasters (oil spills, toxic dumping, radioactive waste 
dispersions) cause death and make an area unliveable far beyond the 
initial event.

The speed limit on commuter tracks in the northeast is 120MPH.  We
already have something that resembles high speed rail in this
country and it requires massive government subsidies.  We don't need
another government boondoggle.

This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good
solution.  One approach is simply to try and move political opinion
and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another
approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original
constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention
for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.
The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains
government (particularly state and local), even though on many
particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think
libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via
an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).

Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as
a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might
be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If
a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then
falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is
unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held
for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,
but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,
if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.

It would if malpractice and "defensive medicine" were the main
factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs, but they aren't.

Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are
greater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall
difference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat larger
portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)

Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of
total health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of 
physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged
paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  
Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;
they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health
care costs have increased more than any period in history.

As far as "defensive medicine" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its
total impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total
current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group
that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine
on health care.

As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,
Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification
of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their
specialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits
while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.

Steve,  you're the one who suggested that a failed government should be an 
ideal proving ground,  I never felt that way in the first place.  Quite the 
contrary,  I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already
had a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression,  yet had a
strong spirit of individualism and initiative.  Someplace like... Texas :-)

Okay,  let me try to explain this.

When one votes for such a creature as a Senator or,  worse yet,  a President,
one votes not for specific policies but for a general package which must cover
all issues for 4 or 6 years.  As such,  one's influence is highly diluted.
I might add that,  even if one were free to vote on individual regulations,
the vast amount of time required for considering a particular regulation,
combined with the very small chance of one's vote making a difference,  would
make it unreasonable to expect the voter to make an intelligent decision
with respect to specific regulations.

I'm not sure what you mean by "feasible" in this case.  Do you mean that

2 of the four you saw fit to  mention,  and education of minors is always
another possibility,  since minors are generally considered not to be

:(It is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to

You say this as if it were surprising,  yet in fact a necessary consequence
of libertarian philosophy.  All non-coersive functions should be dealt 
with privately,  therefore it follows that the only functions remaining to
the state are the coersive ones.

Much more likely it's drunken teenagers.  The groups in questionare more

event that you missed my earlier sarcasm,  let me say this directly:
The idea that such programs as Social Security or AFDC should be considered
"defense" (an idea which has been advanced in ths and other newsgroups) is
so absurd a lie as to be unworthy of consideration.  Do you seriously
dispute this?


	I don't want to seem patronizing,  but you still seem to be laboring
under the delusion that under a socialized economic system it is reasonably
intelligent and honest persons (like yourself) who make the decisions.
I feel any third party added to a transaction is every bit as likely to be
ignorant or corrupt as the buyer or seller.  I don't expect you to agree
with me,  but you explain why you feel I'm wrong?

I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (They
were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  Immediately
after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an "Objection!" heard
in the background.  The clip ended at that point so I don't know if the
objection was upheld.  I can't imagine NC is *that* bad.

This I didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on
news stories both during and after the trial.  Now the "we did it on purpose"
thing is stretching, I think it was something more like--he had it coming.  If
somebody else remebers better than I on this second point, feel free to

up here) during the Thomas nomination hearings.  Surely, one would think
that her claim to having been sexually harassed, would have a great deal
less credibility if it could be shown that she had herself been guilty of it.

Ahemmm....  It depends.  :-)

(For instance, if it were the "sworn statements" at the Warren Commission,
then yes, I _would_ say that the statements were no better than toilet
paper, used at that :-), but in most cases, the answer would be "no").

Wait a minute.  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility
for their own behavior (I assume that's what you meant by the word
"account"), but also for "the behavior of their immediate community"?

First of all, how "immediate" are you talking about, and secondly, I
have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
accounting for the actions of a different person...

     What kind of brainless clod doesn't understand the difference 
     between a "PROPOSED BILL, BLOCKED IN CONGRESS" and an "EXECUTIVE
     ORDER, ISSUED BY CLINTON, AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS".

     
  Here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:

     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates, Uncle Sam
     has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities.

     In effect, Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into
     one giant S&L, waiting to blow.

     Short-term rates rise --->  Interest payments on Deficit rise --->
     Uncle Sammy has to borrow more ---->  Causing Short-term rates to rise.

     Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop.  His options:

       i) Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount
       ii)  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts

    Results of i):  large numbers of pissed-off citizens
    Results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens


    Uncle Sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to pre-empt the use
    of communication newtworks to foster a nation-wide, grassroots
    uprising.

You said it worked so well with tobacco.  I was being fascisious(I can't spell 
worth a damn)

Look, this is getting ridiculous, first, I think tobacco should be legal.  
Anybody who can't see the difference between tobacco and marijuana has got to 
be high.

I have to agree with you... the police may have carried it a bit too far
but Rodney King was no angel either. And I don't think ANY guilty
verdicts should have been returned. I'm sure you know why they handed
down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. It's quite simple really,
it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities
think it's right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to
see them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your
skin was even slightly brown.

Hey, my motto is, you don't fuck with me or my stuff and you don't get
killed. It's just that simple.

What kind of witnesses?  If we are talking about witnesses who were at
the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics,
emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the
first trial.  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and
forgot to call all of your witnesses.

If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new
interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find
such witnesses.  If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser
could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser
becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new
expert witnesses).

Probably, law enforcement people (Park Service Police and D.C. cops),
who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the
density of the crowd in small regions.

These sort of techniques derive from Army Intelligence and CIA
methods of estimating troop strength, and tend to be
methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers,
so as to justify bigger budgets.

Not at all.  I am not a member of the Religious Left, Right, or even

How typical.  So you think we shouldn't avoid these 'events' [ I shall
refrain from the word disaster since it seems to upset you so much.  :( ]
when we can.  In case you didn't realize it, the natural disasters [ oops,
sorry events ] you are refering to  we have no control over.  Man-made
ones we do.

I guess you missed the show on Ch 20 earlier this week about the disaster
[ oops there I go again... I meant to say event ] on the Exxon Valdez.
Just a natural every day occurance to spread oil on 300 Miles of beach. I
would like to know which natural event [ hey I remembered not to say disaster ]

So look, if you want to worship a oil slick ( or toxic waste dump or live
in a house that has a cesspool in the front yard ), fine, you have my
permission to do so [ yea right like you need MY permission... ], it just
won't be in the neighborhood where I live.  But DON'T try to push your
shortsighted tunnelvision views off on the rest of us.

Evidence given for her prostitute status, besides the admittedly 
questionable claim of the man on trial included:

1. Prior employment in a number of massage parlors, with women who
claimed that she worked as a prostitute;

2. Walking around a truck stop at 4:00 AM wearing a lace miniskirt,
a halter top, and no underwear of any sort;

3. Not having a purse or other I.D. with her.

Not enough to convict her, but enough to create reasonable doubt
whether a rape actually took place, or theft of services.

Are you just ignorant, or lying again?

The accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self-
defense, and the judge agreed that they were so operating.

Oddly enough, dependent coverage costs a bit more than for one self
alone.  But if you really believe your claims, you could make a lot
of money starting the "Homosexuals Health Insurance Co." and refuse to
insure "breeders."  But I shudder to think what your premiums will be
like.

This country is hardly ruined. In fact, it is booming compared to after the
1980 election.

This whole "USA has gone to hell and Reagan/Bush caused it", is not only lame,
pathetic, and old....... it's wrong.

Under Reagan/Bush the economy grew by 1.1 trillion dollars.  This is more than 
the entire economy of Germany, a "kind, gentle" country, in many peoples' 
books.  What a joke.

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS

                          The Briefing Room



1:04 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Good afternoon.  
	     
	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would be nice.  Let's go out 
to the cherry blossoms.  We'll do like the President.
	     
	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead? 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks?  You 
said it was a good visit, but no compromise.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  The President had a good talk 
with Senator Dole last night.  I think that as we said before, there 
were no specific compromises on either side, although it was a very 
good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as 
well.  As you know, the President first called Senator Dole I believe 
Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package.  They did not 
speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the 
President was out.  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake, and at the close 
of that conversation, indicated that he wanted to speak to the 
President about the jobs and stimulus package.  They finally talked 
about that yesterday afternoon.
	     
	     At the close of that discussion they said that they 
would have another talk last night, which they did, when the Senator 
was up in New Hampshire.  And although there were no specific 
compromises made on either side, they did say that they would 
continue to have some discussions.  And that's where we are.
	     
	     Q	  Well, who is giving in?  Where is it standing --are 
both making concessions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that it's at that 
phase.  No compromise has been made.  As the President has said 
consistently, he intends to come forward with an adjusted package.  
He believes in the package, but he believes that if it's going to 
take adjustments to get the minority to release it, he's willing to 
make those adjustments.
	     
	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, boy.
	     
	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes --
	     
	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made, but what would 
lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sorry, Andrea, I'm not going to go 
down that road.  No decisions have been made.  As the President said 
this morning, a number of groups, a number of members of Congress, a 
number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked 
at.  The working group is looking at it, but no decisions have been 
made.
	     
	     Q	  To follow, have they done that directly through 
him?  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President 
about it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, although 
there's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the 
VAT.  But the President has not made a decision.
	     
	     Q	  At the meetings that he's had with his own task 
force advisers, have they discussed the funding issue and what the 
possible options would be?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that that has been 
presented for a decision, no.
	     
	     Q	  Not for a decision, but has it been discussed as an 
option?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, there are a lot of levels of 
briefing.  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the 
President as, okay, this is something for you to decide on.  
	     
	     Q	  You're not saying he didn't know it was being 
considered, though, are you?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he said it's being considered.
	     
	     Q	  He knew that.
	     
	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers?  
That's what I'm asking.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said it's being 
considered.  I do not know what level of discussion there has been 
over the VAT.  It is something the working groups are looking at.  I 
don't even know that it's --
	     
	     Q	  But he didn't say he was considering, did he, at 
this stage?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, he is not.  I think we're 
getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here.  What is 
considered -- 
	     
	     Q	  Well, he is the one who said, I haven't reviewed 
it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That is true.  That is what I just 
repeated. 
	     
	     Q	  George, is there any concern here that as a result 
of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if 
it were to be considered he'd let us know, and having it trickle out 
the way it did, that there may now be the development of a 
credibility gap on this issue and others?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.  I mean, it is 
now public knowledge that this is being considered.
	     
	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute 
statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it 
was off the table and was not being considered, and then to have it 
come out not from you people, but --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, wait a second.  It came out 
from the administration.  What are you talking about?
	     
	     Q	  What I'm saying is, though, that the President said 
he would let us know. 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.
	     
	     Q	  You people then said -- you said, I believe, that 
it's not going to be on the program.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On March 25th.
	     
	     Q	  On March 25th. 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Circumstances change.
	     
	     Q	  Well, I understand.  But we have to find that out 
by rooting around in the fine print of an interview
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Rooting around -- I know you did do 
a very good job there to read the USA Today article.  But this is --
(laughter) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services.  I mean, that is common anytime you guys 
write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the 
Clinton administration, the headline is -- I'll look at it right 
here, and AP story -- "Clinton wants more money for spying."
	     
	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being 
considered, he'd tell us about it?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the administration's concerned, 
and he'd let you know.
	     
	     Q	  And did he?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  Absolutely.  What did he say 
this morning?
	     
	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It didn't have to be dragged out of 
me.  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB, we had the Secretary of 
Health of Human Services say it was being considered.  That is his 
administration.  That is his administration policy.
	     
	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons, or were they 
orchestrated leaks?  I mean, what was the --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked questions, they 
answered the questions.
	     
	     Q	  You're saying here that it didn't have to be 
dragged out, that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were 
considering it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  I was very clear.  
Painfully clear.
	     
	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making 
it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax 
day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it was just this issue is being 
considered.  They were asked if it was being considered; they 
answered that it was being considered.
	     
	     Q	  George, The New York Times --
	     
	     Q	  Why do it yesterday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They were asked.
	     
	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary 
Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and 
oranges numbers in order to portray last month's unemployment figures 
in a way that was supportive of the President's job stimulus bill, 
but which turned out to be totally false.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it was totally 
false, but I think -- (laughter) -- the chief economist at the Labor 
Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing, and they 
say that. 
	     
	     Q	  The question is, is the President concerned about 
behavior that amounts to corrupting government data?  And what's he 
doing about it, if so?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The chief economist has said that a 
mistake was made, it won't happen again, and that's the end of the 
matter.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that the same information that goes to the 
President?
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's two separate pieces of 
information.  I think that's where the confusion was.
	     
	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake 
that was made?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I read the article this morning.
	     
	     Q	  And as far as you know, is the President aware of 
it?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so.
	     
	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in 
The New York Times?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  Not to my knowledge.
	     
	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning?  
Anything?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't.
	     
	     Q	  Wasn't the President given an erroneous spin on 
this for his own purpose?  For his speeches, for his arguments?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well again, I'm not sure.  Both 
statements are true.  What the Labor Department has granted is that 
mixing them in one sentence, essentially, was misleading.  They said 
it was a mistake.  They said they wouldn't do it again.
	     
	     Q	  Did they drop it -- is this something that you 
choose to spin or make an issue of?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Whenever fewer people are out of 
work, we're gratified.  But that doesn't take away from the need to 
get this jobs package going.
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a 
minute.  You said that the President plans to come forward with an 
amendment.  Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment 
would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday, or did he, in 
the conversation with Dole, talk about the possibility of putting 
that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think at this point there's no 
changes in the schedule at all.  I don't know that they discussed the 
timing like that.
	     
	     Q	  Do you believe that you're closer or getting closer 
this week than you were last week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I believe that we're going 
to pass a jobs package.  The President is prepared to make 
adjustments in order to get that to happen.  I don't know where the 
votes are on cloture at this particular time.  I don't know what's 
going to happen until we have a vote.  But the President believes 
deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done.
	     
	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation 
has changed?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work on 
it.  We'll know when the votes are taken.
	     
	     Q	  George, last week you said that there are -- or 
various people in the administration were saying that you couldn't go 
through Dole, you were going to have to try and go around him because 
he was immovable on this subject of a compromise, or at least the 
compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could 
accept.  This week you're talking to him.  Is that because you've 
realized that the peeling off effort wasn't going to work?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's because Senator Dole wanted 
to talk to the President about the stimulus package.
	     
	     Q	  He initiated the conversation?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that, in fact, 
the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all.  You 
say he's making --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know that that's exactly 
what he said.  I think he said he didn't have any indication that 
there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise, 
and the President doesn't want to compromise.  And the President 
doesn't want to compromise.  But if he has to make adjustments to get 
it through, he will.
	     
	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was 
working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before 
the actual vote.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's possible.
	     
	     Q	  Today?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when that will 
happen, but I think that it's very possible that we'll come forward 
with some sort of a different package, or Senate Democrats will come 
forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it 
passed.
	     
	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole, the 
first one was some discussion of this and I'll get back to you 
tonight with some details or some adjustments, or whatever the phrase 
is.  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a question of how 
detailed.  I mean, I think they had a general discussion about the 
package last night, subsequent to their conversation yesterday 
afternoon.  I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today 
in the Senate, not necessarily between the President and Senator 
Dole.  And let me just reiterate, neither side has made specific 
compromises at this date.  When we have something we'll let you know.  
And I'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that 
we've talked about or that we've offered anything in a hard way.
	     
	     Q	  What are the follow-up discussions if not the 
President and Dole?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think Senator Mitchell is going 
to talk to Senator Dole.
	     
	     Q	  Is that a threat?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole, all right, 
how about this number as an overall size, or did Dole say to the 
President, I can go as high as this?  Did they talk numbers?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was a negotiation 
in that respect.  It was more of a discussion about their positions.
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  I know they 
talked about the basic outlines of the packages.  I think they talked 
about the programs they cared about.  I don't know if they got to the 
level of this many x-billion dollars. 
	     
	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a 
package?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, of course not.
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the 
protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole 
was speaking?  Was that in any way organized by --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.
	     
	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators 
Kohl or Feingold?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he's talked to them, 
no.
	     
	     Q	  George, is the President considering the more 
palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the 
haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots?  And is he going 
to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few, with the haves 
having to pay for the have-nots?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes deeply that 
the tax rates on upper income Americans, as he presented in his 
budget, should go up.  And I think for the second half of your 
question, I'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday.
	     
	     Q	  George, on the subject of accuracy in information, 
you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money 
that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee.  Apparently that is 
not true.  It's actually waste water money.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's waste water money for 
Wisconsin, and some could go to Milwaukee. 
	     
	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem 
because it's waste water money, right?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It would affect the water treatment 
overall. 
	     
	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other 
day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now.  
Would you agree that's not the case?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure of the specifics.  I 
know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin.
	     
	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning, which was, 
when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating 
on a VAT?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure exactly when.  I just 
don't know.  I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between 
the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago.  
	     
	     Q	  So sometime since March 25th?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's right.  I don't know 
the exact date.
	     
	     Q	  George, the President this morning mentioned that 
some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax.  Apparently, the 
National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax 
being okay if it replaces the BTU tax.  So does the President feel 
that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he's proposed, 
or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he's already 
proposed?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we've said all we have to 
say about the VAT at this point.  I mean, there's just no -- this is 
being considered by the health care working groups, and that is all.  
The President hasn't made any further decisions beyond that. 
	     
	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care, it wouldn't 
be to replace some other tax that finances -- it wouldn't replace the 
income tax, for instance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There have been no discussions on 
that.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress, 
Senator Dole's press release today said VAT -- on tax day.  Do you 
think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress?  Would it 
have a chance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have no idea. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it 
forward?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That would become a consideration 
if the President were to decide to do it.  It's not in consideration 
now.
	     
	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that 
circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under 
consideration.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, what the President referred to 
this morning.  These groups came forward and said this is something 
that has to be considered.
	     
	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed?  
That's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled 
it out that groups have asked it to be considered?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what he said. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that true?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Was there, in fact, some understanding that sin 
taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to get into the 
deliberations.
	     
	     Q	  But, George --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  What the consideration is, as 
the President said, groups came forward and said this is something 
you ought to consider.  The working groups are looking at it. 
	     
	     Q	  Is that the only thing that's changed since his 
prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups -- how that 
information got to him that groups wanted it?  Was it just reading 
the newspaper or did groups make presentations?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the groups -- as you know, 
the health care task force has met with dozens of groups.
	     
	     Q	  But this is the President's knowledge that these 
groups had come forward.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was referring to what 
was coming to the working groups.  Obviously, there have also been 
published positions in the newspapers.
	     
	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the group's 
presentations to them?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've briefed him 
-- I mean, how detailed the briefings have been.    I know that the 
working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these 
groups.
	     
	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that 
were persuasive enough that the President would change the position 
that he had enunciated previously?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know, it's just they've had 
longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance 
health care.
	     
	     Q	  The President wasn't aware of those longstanding 
positions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He may have been at some level.  
Obviously, he's been a governor for a long time and he knows the 
basic arguments for and against a VAT tax.
	     
	     Q	  What we're trying to figure out here -- you're 
telling us that the only change, the only thing that affected this 
change in the President's attitude toward the VAT between February 
and now --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's attitude hasn't 
necessarily changed.  I mean, he has not made a decision.
	     
	     Q	  I know, but the President said that it was off the 
table.  So did you.  And you're saying that the only thing that's 
changed is the positions of these groups, except you're also 
describing them as longstanding positions.  I don't see the change.  
If these groups haven't had any change in their position that's been 
made to the President --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, they've made the 
presentations to the health care task force.
	     
	     Q	  There's no relationship at all between the fact 
that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he 
favored will not produce enough revenue to finance --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think he ever suggested 
that they would produce all the revenue.
	     
	     Q	  Well, he suggested that he thought that those were 
appropriate ways to finance health care.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He did say that.  I don't know that 
he said anything to refute that.
	     
	     Q	  But, in fact, has the task force discovered that 
there wouldn't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind 
of core benefits --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't think that the task 
force ever suggested that there would.
	     
	     Q	  George, if he advocated a VAT tax, would that break 
his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his 
programs?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't comment on a hypothetical 
situation.
	     	  
	     Q	  But does that promise -- would that promise not to 
raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him 
from seeking a VAT tax?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has made no decisions 
on the VAT tax.  When he does, we'll tell you and we'll explain the 
implications then.
	     
	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite -- business, 
labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task 
force has prompted this consideration?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't have the specific.  I just 
don't have that.
	     
	     Q	  George, can you tell us to what extend these other 
alternatives, for instance, the employer tax or the sin taxes or 
other financing options are also still on the table and what these 
options are?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, as members of the task force 
and representatives of the working groups have said, they are looking 
at a wide variety of options.  I think that Ira Magaziner said that 
there are 20 different options under consideration.  But I'm not 
going to comment --
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not going to comment on 
them, no.
	     
	     Q	  What's the scope of the need?  How much are you 
talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's what the health care task 
force is looking at.
	     
	     Q	  Since there's not going to be any briefing on the 
Miyazawa visit, two questions:  One, generally what does the 
President hope to use that meeting for, but more specifically, is his 
task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and 
the remark about market access at the press conference?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Vancouver note?
	     
	     Q	  Does no mean yes.
	     
	     Q	  Yes and no.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know.  I saw the 
Prime Minister's press conference where he was asked the question 
about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when 
he was asked the question.  The questions of trade are something that 
certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the 
President.  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and 
the U.S. that we want to do something about.
	     
	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he 
suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in 
terms of trade.  Are you going to oblige?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:   I think the President will state 
our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit 
very clearly.  I don't necessarily want to agree with your 
characterization of the Prime Minister's comments.
	     
	     Q	     that we need specific export targets, specific 
numerical targets -- is that what he's going to discuss with 
Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're going to have a broad 
discussion of a wide range of trade issues.  I don't want to get into 
those specifics until after the meeting.
	     
	     Q	  Why?
	     
	     Q	   That's the crux of the issue, right?  Whether or 
not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical 
targets, it is really, as he said in his press conference, sort of 
hopeless that this is going to change very much?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that we must 
have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around.  I do not 
want to get into the specifics of how that would be done.
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus 
package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think, first, the President wants 
to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister 
Miyazawa himself, and then he'll make the comment on it.
	     
	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package?  There seems to 
be some confusion about how the U.S. views that, Secretary 
Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do 
more, the Japanese saying that that's not what they heard?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, we're going to continue to 
work with all our allies in the G-7, and we're going to continue to 
press for help for Russian reform, Russian democratic reform.  And I 
think that, so far, we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and 
we're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral 
packages.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're going to continue to work 
with all our allies to do as much as we can.
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today 
Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher's comments on 
the Bosnia policy.  And he said, "It's a rather emotional response."  
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Over an emotional issue.
	     
	     Q	  Right -- to an emotional problem.  Does the White  
House condone that kind of remark?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that Secretary 
Christopher's remarks speaks for itself.  The President believes also 
that this is a deeply troubling situation that we're trying to find 
answers for. 
	     
	     Q	  But that specific -- "rather emotional response" -- 
specific term?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, it speaks for itself.
	     
	     Q	  In connection with that, doesn't it seem that with 
the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment, is it 
good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now 
to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  For example?
	     
	     Q	  To take stronger action, to take military action -- 
air strikes, anything that can be done?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that what 
must be done now is to push harder for sanctions.  He is also -- as 
you know, the administration has been discussing lifting the arms 
embargo.  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase 
pressure at this time.
	     
	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say 
that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain 
the presidency?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They're wrong.  We're pressing hard 
for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table.  We're pressing hard 
for increased sanctions, and we're talking to our allies about the 
arms embargo.
	     
	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen 
getting people to agree to that.  Now, Vance and Owen have both said 
that military force to some extent would be acceptable.  Does that 
change your thinking?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Clearly, we're going to listen to 
whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to 
say.  But at this point, the President is moving forward on sanctions 
and talking about the arms embargo.
	     
	     Q	  A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning.  She 
said she would be able to provide some administration officials who 
could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia.  Are 
you going to be able to do that, or do you have anything --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's what she said.
	     
	     Q	  That's exactly what she said.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think that's true.  But 
what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of 
evidence can be provided in Bosnia.  Obviously, if there are 
connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and 
we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade, that will have 
an effect over time.  I do not know day by day, minute by minute, 
what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact 
effect has been.   But, clearly, we are slowing the shipment of goods 
into Belgrade.  We are having an effect on the Serbs there.  What 
kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I don't 
know.  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at 
all, I don't know why they'd be fighting it so much.
	     
	     Q	  Are the First Lady's tax returns going to be 
released?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a joint tax return.  
And it will be probably later today.
	     
	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive 
order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work 
force as part of the gay rights march here next week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think there's any proposal 
for that at this time, not that I know of.
	     
	     Q	  It's something that the President promised during 
the campaign that he would do.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I have not seen any -- I don't 
think it's anything that's on his plate right now.
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point 
on this issue?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know about on this issue.  
I assume that he'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian 
community sometime soon, as he meets with representatives of lots of 
different groups and communities.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if that's scheduled --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's probably going to be tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  It's a good thing you asked.
	     
	     Q	  Who's probably going to be there?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
	     
	     Q	  How long --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  That's all I know.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if it's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow?  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what time it is.  I 
don't even know for sure if it's going to be tomorrow.
	     
	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major 
speech next week of some kind.  Is that going to happen, do you know?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they've asked, but 
I think the President has always planned, as he did last year, to 
give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will.  If it's not 
exactly on Earth Day, it might be a day before or something like 
that.
	     
	     Q	  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of 
the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know the specific 
timing of something like that, but it's certainly something under 
discussion and something we've been working on.
	     
	     Q	  Campaign finance reform?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We're working on it.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think it will be next week?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.
	     
	     Q	  The biodiversity treaty is something you're working 
on?  I missed the question.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, something we're working on.  
He asked if it was ready to be signed, and I said I didn't know 
anything about that but it's something we've certainly been working 
on.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what organizations might be represented 
in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out 
of town on the day of the march?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's got to be at the Senate 
meeting in Jamestown, and I believe he's also going to be giving a 
speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston 
on Sunday, as he did last year.
	     
	     Q	  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you 
on the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  On what?
	     
	     Q	  On the gays.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  When we went through the 
President's schedule for the day, certainly.
	     
	     Q?	    George, what day is the publisher's speech?  Is 
that Sunday?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it's a Sunday.
	     
	     Q	  And Saturday he'll be in Jamestown?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  So you're just going to be in Jamestown for one 
day?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I'm not sure.  I don't know how 
long the Senate thing goes.  It might go overnight.  I just don't 
know.
	     
	     Q	  You would have made the gay meeting public, right?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain if we had the meeting 
-- I don't know about open to the press, but we would have told you 
about it.
	     
	     Q	  I mean, because it is, as far as I can tell, the 
first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with --  

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I didn't say it was going to be in 
the Oval Office.  (Laughter.)  But I didn't -- I'm not say that it's 
not, but I didn't say that it was.  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	     at the White House in the Bush administration 
gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White 
House had to repudiate having done that.  So I just wanted to make 
sure --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the President wouldn't do 
anything like that.
	     
	     Q	  Certainly not.
	     
	     Q	  What marching orders did the President give to 
General Vessey?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They had a very good discussion for 
about half an hour today.  He wanted -- the most important thing was 
he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs.  He will 
obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document.  
The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting 
and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes 
in our policy towards Vietnam.  He'll be looking at Vietnam's 
response to the questions raised by the document and he'll also look 
into investigations on discrepancy cases, increased efforts on 
remains, implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to 
military archives.  
	     
	     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the 
activities of the joint commission and on the document.
	     
	     Q	  Vietnam says it's a fake.  What is the DOD analysis 
at this stage?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's not completed yet, and it's 
also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the 
Vietnamese.
	     
	     Q	  A number of Defense officials have been saying that 
they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are, in fact, 
non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to 
as Americans from time to time.  Do people -- 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We don't have any final 
determination.  We're going to wait for the complete review; when we 
have it, we'll make a judgment.
	     
	     Q	  I know you don't have any final determination, but 
given all of the intense public interest in this, do you think that 
that's a likely possibility?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't want to characterize 
it in any way until the review is complete.
	     
	     Q	  George, was there a topic scheduled for the speech 
in Boston?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. 
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to have a press conference 
tomorrow with Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think so, but I'm not positive.  
Yes, I expect, yes.
	     
	     Q	  Was Toon in with Vessey?  
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes. 
	     
	     Q	  He was in on the meeting?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  What was the question?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey, 
and the answer is yes. 
	     
	     Q	  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal 
report this morning the President's distressed about some of his 
press clippings and that perhaps he's distressed with you about that?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  Well, I do have a response.  I 
think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied 
that the President has had restricted access to the press.  I would 
point out that he's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions, more than 
any of his predecessors. I would also point out it also --
	     
	     Q	  How many questions?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Three hundred fifty-eight, on 77 
occasions.
	     
	     Q	  How many were while he was jogging?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, no, that's actually a very 
good question, Andrea.  And I would point out further that the 
article also implied that these questions were only answered at 
tightly controlled photo opportunities, which is just patently false.  
He's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room, the Oval 
Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room, in addition to 
questions taken at photo opportunities, and that is only the --
	     
	     Q	  Oval Office press conference -- when was that? 
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's answered questions in the --
East Room.  He's had five in the East Room, he's had one in the Oval 
Office, he's had one in the Rose Garden, he's had one or two in the 
Roosevelt Room.  And this is just to the White House, Washington 
Press Corps.  In addition to that, he's had 17 interviews with local 
television anchors.  He's met with the editorial board of The 
Portland Oregonian.  He's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather. 
He's had interviews with local press from California, Florida and 
Connecticut --
	     
	     Q	  Can you address the question of the attitude?  The 
article implies that he doesn't --
	     
	     Q	  Why doesn't he like us?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  Did you really get blamed for that Post story?
	     
	     Q	  The story is that you -- are you held responsible 
for it.
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think I'm going to comment 
about this.
	     
	     Q	  Are you denying that the President has shown 
displeasure publicly?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I am not commenting on the 
discussions between the President and myself.
	     
	     Q	  Did the President write that letter to Chris 
Webber?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  What?
	     
	     Q	  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball 
player?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, yes.
	     
	     Q	  That is an authentic letter?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Since the President first talked about the VAT in 
February, he said at the time that he thought there probably should 
be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing.  
Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I just can't comment on a 
proposal he hasn't made.
	     
	     Q	  George, does the President have some agenda for 
this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think it will just a 
general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about 
including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights.
	     
	     Q	  The military issue?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm certain it will come up.
	     
	     Q	  Is he using this event to name the AIDS --
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think so.
	     
	     Q	  George, what specifically is the President doing to 
prepare for tomorrow's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's had briefing memos.  He's had 
general discussions with members of the Treasury Department, the 
Trade Representative and others.
	     
	     Q	     report yet?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he has the report 
referred to in The Times, but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him 
today.
	     
	     Q	  He was?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Does he intend to use any of these instances that 
--
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know that the 
report's been presented.  But obviously, the President will press 
hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of the Wall Street Journal, the thrust was 
that there's a real schism here -- a hostility.  Do you think he 
feels that way?
	     
	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  As I said on the 
record in the article, I think the President likes reporters.  Again, 
I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading.  The 
thrust of the article was that in some way, some attitude which the 
President may or may not have is affecting access when, in fact, he 
has the most open, accessible administration than have any in recent 
history.

	     Q	  Can we come up to your office?  (Laughter.)

	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  If you're invited.  
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

                                 END                    1:34 P.M. EDT

The DEA and other organizations would have the American people
believe that we are winning the "war on drugs".  I'm going to
dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing
you the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions
I've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly
demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the
rise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug
abuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality
is, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,
substance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a
possible solution to this problem.

The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music
and pot entitled "Hello Again, Mary Jane" which appears in the
current issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).

    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing
    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  "Perhaps
    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby
    is out in full force," says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug
    Enforcement Administration.  "The fact is, they're losing the
    battle."  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said
    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner
    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that
    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of
    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.

The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993
issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders" by Mike
Snider, p. 6D).

We are not winning the "war on drugs".  I think you can see that one
of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that
the "war on drugs" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---
only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone
down.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is
an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to
deceive the public.

Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same
time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).
Also, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down
but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,
if one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*
the statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called "war on drugs" is
being lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs
go, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,
then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed
in its true perspective.

For those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try
drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me
that it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*
drugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless
attempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to
another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.

The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to
legalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be
within reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few
times) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.
The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is
because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the
government's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug
interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug
education).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because
the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often
goes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that
addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their
money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;
legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall
substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.

IMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been
done to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to
employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating
them.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than
they used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought
about by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can
light up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in
order to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods
be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried
out.  They are as follows:

    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which
      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this
      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.
      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used
      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.

    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of
      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs
      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from
      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law
      enforcement.

    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of
      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the
      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.
      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning
      information should also be a felony.

    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the
      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This
      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad
      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.

I'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have
been hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought
it was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)
all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on
WOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it
that you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,
I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my
assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---
something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.

The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993
issue of USA Today ("Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders" by Mike
Snider, p. 6D).

    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are
    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. 

    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results
    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is
    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by
    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students
    nationwide.

    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If
    drug use dropped during the '80s, eventually some students will
    have fewer "drug-using contemporaries" who act as examples of
    substance abuse's drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,
    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths "must be given
    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,"
    Johnston says.

    This type of resurgence "is possible," says Eileen Shiff, author of
    "Experts Advise Parents" (Delta, $14.95).  But that's not the issue,
    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today
    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.

    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with
    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to
    their children.  "I've even seen parents serving kegs of beer" to
    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,
    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, "lock-in" party where
    no booze or drugs were allowed.  "We need to fulfill that parental
    role, otherwise the peer group takes over," she says.

    Officials may "talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven't
    done anything that I've seen," says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,
    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and
    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a
    member of USA Today's Teen Panel, says "there's always going to be
    experimentation" with drugs.

    A real war on drugs could be waged "education-wise," she says.  But
    "some don't want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give
    them ideas; it's the same with birth control.  I think you should
    give the kids the information or have it accessible" through classes,
    pamphlets and speakers, she says.

    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in
    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,
    Fla.  "I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think
    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds
    (about using drugs)," he says.

    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren't working; only
    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens
    with two "good-looking girls" in the restroom talking about having
    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  "That hits home
    because it's not attractive," he says.  "You can't be doing drugs if
    you want somebody to like you."

Let me say this about that, as a retired Navy officer; 

I agree. Cut it.  But let's not stop there. 

Eliminate the C-17 transport. Overwight, overdue, overbudget, it was
supposed to carry tanks. New tanks are now too big for the airplane. 

Scrap the Seawolf SSN-21 nuclear submarine. The breakup of the USSR has
left us with a number of sticky military problems, but NONE of them will
require "God's gift to submarines". 

Ground the B-2 stealth bomber. I'm sure it's a great airplane that will do
EVERYTHING its designers said, but at half-a-gigabuck a copy, we can't
afford for even ONE to crash. And airplanes DO crash. 

Elmo Zumwalt said it best 20+ years ago; "High/Low". A MIX of a FEW
extremely capable weapons systems and a LOT of CHEAPER,
moderate-capability systems.

I agree with most of what Phill says, except the point about it being in
our interests to bring down the oil price.  Consider that both the U.S.

their energy needs.    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany,
Japan and many other "industrial rivals" more than these two.  
In addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
U.A.E. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the U.S. and G.B., 
propping up these economies and further providing an incentive 
to keep prices from falling too low.

OK.  I stand corrected.  I guess, then, that the comments about payoffs
(i.e., "pork") to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still
stands?

Now, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic:

Should the people who are natives of U.S. territories have
representation in the U.S. House of Rep's or the U.S. Congress?
The U.S. Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent
each State in proportion to its population, and the Senate to represent
each State equally.  What should be done with U.S. territories like
Puerto Rico?  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
the past, such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest
Territory?

I'm really surprised Clinton hasn't already tried to do this.  He seems
to want to tackle other irrelevant issues first, so why not this one as well.

Wrong.  We need its capability.  Sure it has its problems, very few
airplanes haven't, but getting rid of something we need is not the
answer.  What do you want to do, start over a rebuild a new airplane
from scatch?  It'll have its problems as well and there will be calls
again, for it to be scrapped.  THe other option is to try to extend
the life of the C-5s and C-141s that are getting extremely old.

>Scrap the Seawolf SSN-21 nuclear submarine.

It'll cost jobs, but I'm for it.  We especially don't need a B-2. THe
SSN-21, I know litttle about.

The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was

Because the judge found that there was some credible evidence that the

With respect to credibility, I would rate Clayton Cramer an order of

Clayton is indeed consistent.  And so are you.

I'm sorry about your friend.  Really.  But this anecdote does nothing to
justify the "war on drugs".  If anything, it demonstrates that the "war"
is a miserable failure.  What it demonstrates is that people will take
drugs if they want to, legal or not.  Perhaps if your friend were taking
legal, regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the
position he's in now.

This is *exactly* what the public in France & Italy perceive to be the

Wrong.  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord.
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style
first-past-the-post system in the Senate.  If implemented, it would
encourage a two- (or perhaps three-) party system in Italy.
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties; rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties
will emerge to dominate.  Will Lega Nord be one of these?  Who knows.

(The Camera dei Deputati (lower house) will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while, but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house, too. Maybe as much as 40% first-past-the-post)

Overall, the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change.  Italians
are tired of having crappy government.  Porn stars, Pavarotti's and
Hunters & Fishers won't gain seats because PR is dead.  A good two-party
system will bring Italy efficient, accountable government.

It's about time.

Yes, it is -- you could look it up.  And spare us the thin-skinned

    The immunization program is just a "useful first step". Among other
    things, the money will go to pay for creating and maintaning a
    a computerized "innoculation" database on all U.S. children.
    (code-named Big Mother... Just kidding, the name will be Children
    Defense Database, or something like that.)

    Once the money is spent and little or no tangible results achieved, 
    the goverment will have to start knocking down doors, in some 
    neigborhoods, and bribe parents in others (probably the ones that 
    are paying kids for attending the school - what a fantastic idea!)

Actually, Jerry Brown essentially did...and Clinton, in his demagogue
persona, condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year.

However....

Why don't the Republicans get their act together, and say they
will support a broad-based VAT that would have to be visible
(the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe)
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform, and
force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax
rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
be increased only via a national referendum.

Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile...
shift the tax burden from investment to consumption, and get
health care reform, and a frozen low top marginal tax rate
all in one fell swoop.

	They are two witnesses who didn't come forth until after the first
trial.  While it would be "tough luck" for GM if they new about these witnesses
beforehand, IMO this constitutes "new evidence".

I do read Av Week and don't remember this.  Could you supply the date

Excellently put!

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I
like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale
that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was
private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and
I enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will
never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently
about having to help pay for it.)

However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to
give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,
we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely
because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other
issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the
sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just
whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech
should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can
imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority
on a case-by-case basis.

Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly
what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.

Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a
case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a
case-by-case basis.

There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with
free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a
government that interferes with free enterprise in an "efficient"
manner; I call it political market failure.

Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to
swallow the "whole libertarian agenda."

Unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented
here either.  Due to rounding, the 1991 est. for LSD could be anywhere
from .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949.
This means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the
first place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%.  Similarly the increase in
cocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase of
crack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%.  This doesn't even
take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.

This does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded,
but it does mean that USA Today has (not surprisingly) provided us
with virtually no information.

What kind of brainless clod posted the above garbage? Would they be
so kind as to explain how this is "Clinton's" initiative, when it
has been before Congress for "at least the past 6 months"?

Actually, I bet you more gay/bi men are as not as promiscuous as gay men, 
because more of them could have the "option" of living a straight life, and

As one of the "Clintonites" cited above, I'll try to clarify since this
is not a case of Clinton's "dishonesty." (I won't necessarily defend him
on other issues.)  

There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community
Development Block Grant portion of the President's proposal.  Congressional
Republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what
they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL 
projects prepared by the US Mayors' Conference before the stimulus package
was ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the
White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted
to Congress.  It didn't work.)

The $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close
to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it
were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and
at what level.

In the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley's home district, no one ever
expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the 
Republicans' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS
PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total 
amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus 
package for ALL projects.  

The plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction
and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are
places where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the
bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million
or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing
priorities.

If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects
that will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton
administration has been publicizing the issue.

A final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is
worth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans' opposition to them
is new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally 
supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,
arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending
priorities than "Washington bureaucrats."  

Is it clear now?  Or is this all too complicated to understand?

I was a graduate student in the early 1980s, and we had a conference on 
Reaganomics where Jerry Jordan, then a member of the Council of Economic 
Advisors, was a speaker.  I had the pleasure of driving him back to the 
airport afterwards, and since taxes were the main topic of discussion I 
thought I would ask him about the VAT.  I have favored it for these reasons 
you mention, that the income base is too hazy to define, that it taxes 
savings and investment, that it is likely to be more visible.  He agreed, 
and reported that the CEA at that time was in favor of VAT.  So why not 
propose it?  I asked.  He replied that the Reagan White House feared that 
the Democrats would introduce VAT *in addition to* the income tax, rather 
than in lieu.  Better not to give them any ideas, he said.

Pretty prescient.

Yes, any Canadian readers, please tell us if the tax is displayed on price

Psalm85(JPS): For the leader. Of the Korahites. A psalm. O LORD, You
will favor Your land, restore Jacob's fortune; You will forgive Your
people's iniquity, pardon all their sins; Selah; You will withdraw all Your
anger, turn away from Your rage. Turn again, O God, our helper, revoke
Your displeasure with us. Will you be angry with us forever, prolong
Your wrath for all generations? Surely You will revive us again, so that
Your people may rejoice in You. Show us, O LORD, Your faithfulness;
grant us Your deliverance. Let me hear what God, the LORD, will speak;
He will promise well-being to His people, His faithful ones; may they
not turn to folly. His help is very near those who fear Him, to make His
glory dwell in our land. Faithfulness and truth meet; justice and
well-being kiss. Truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down
from heaven. The LORD also bestows His bounty; our land yields its
produce. Justice goes before Him as He sets out on His way.

Because you are not being consistent.  Moral systems must be consistent.

A person who thinks they can inflict pain on others, but doesn't want it 
inflicted upon themselves, has a double standard.  And double standards are
a violation of *any* moral system.

Pain isn't immoral, stupid.  Pain itself is just a physiological
reaction.

Or brussel sprouts, for that matter.

Yes, if it is sentient matter.

Your last remark is a contradiction, but I'll let that pass.

I was addressing the notion of the Great Commission, which
you deleted in order to provide us with dull little homilies.
Thank you, Bing Crosby.  Now you go right on back to sleep
and mommy and daddy will tuck you in later.

Oh, and how convenient his bible must have been to Michael
Griffin, how convenient his Christianity.  "Well, I'll just
skip the bit about not murdering people and loving the sinner
and hating the sin and all that other stuff for now and
concentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing
something wrong, you should shoot him in the back several times
as he tries to hobble away on his crutches."

I'll leave the "convert or die" program of the missionaries and
their military escorts in the Americas for Nadja to explain as
she knows much more about it than I.

Must be awfully convenient, by the way, to offer platitudes
as you have done, David, rather than addressing the arguments.

You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I
see it used normally.

And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to
"the real world".

Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe
and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning
those perceptions.

It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.
Values are ... well they are what I value.
They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience
rather than not, and so on.

Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are
applicable to everyone.

>If there is no such thing as objective value, then science can not

I don't agree.
Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are
accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on
my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe)
versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.

But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the 
perceptions :-)

>Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said
>to be more useful than a set of tarot cards.  

I don't see why.
'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period.
Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or
can't be shown to be accurate.
Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.

Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.

No?

Let's see, if Alexander destroyed Tyre, and people move back, and
they construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there
and still call it Tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt. Instead
it's considered to be 'just-some-people-that-got-together-for-fishing-

Sigh, I was never born in a city then (my home town has 10.000
people). I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from
now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded
in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms
were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities
along the coast of Finland.

I would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the 
small fishing place of Tyre in Acts. Again, maybe he was a keen
fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre? :-)

Kent

Gong!

Take a moment and look at what you just wrote. First you defined
an "objective" morality and then you qualified this "objective" morality
with subjective justifications. Do you see the error in this?

Sorry, you have just disqualified yourself, but please play again.

You keep saying that. I do not think it means what you think it
means.
Perhaps you should explain what you think "science has it's basis
in values" means. The reason why people DO science is that
they value it's results. That does not mean that science has
it's basis in values. Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed "Pro-Life" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

Precisely.

There's no objective medicine; some people get marvellous results from
alternative therapy, others only respond to traditional medicine.

There's no objective physics; Einstein and Bohr have told us that.

There's no objective reality.  LSD should be sufficient to prove that.

I consider it to be a useful fiction; an abstract ideal we can strive
towards.  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string, it doesn't
actually exist; but we can talk about things as if they were like it, and not
be too far wrong.

Well, there are two approaches we can take here.  One is to ask you what this
objective morality is, assuming it's not a secret.

The other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism, so that we
can correct your misconceptions :-)

Christian anti-Semitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should
know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not
convert to Christianity en mass, thus rejecting "Christian Love."

I don't see why not. Where are the rest of the tribal people? What
happened to the tribes of the Americas? Culture is seen as different and
undesirable in the West, particular in the US with its failed "melting
pot concept." Most tribes have been hunted to extinction, the Hebrew
tribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic. Of course it
becomes difficult at times to separate Christianity from the Western
experience, so perhaps you are right, perhaps it would have been a better 
world if the cultural experiment in Christianity never happened.

Who said Christians want to conform to the teachings of Jesus?

"You are the light of the world. A city can't be hidden lying on a

ever go away until everthing has come to pass. So anyone who dissolves
even one of the smallest commandments and teaches others the same way,

Not entirely.  Its not a premise, its a conclusion.  Second, that scientists
(for the most part) exlude the possibility is not a problem, its a necessity.

Absolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs). Lucy (Australopithecus
afarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40% complete, and about 80% taking into 
consideration bilateral symmetry.  Lucy walked upright and bipedally, just 
like humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  Her
cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  There are hundreds of 
other specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially* 
reconstructed.  They exist Bill.  You can touch them, feel them, hold them.  
But forget hominids.  The earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and 
test out as ancient indeed.  They are not reconstructions.  Has God has tricked
us here too?  It won't go away, Bill.

That was not your point, Bill.  Your point above was God *has* the power ....

So it was a complete non-sequitur, is that it?     How does coming
up with a derisory deal tell us anything about the existence of
"objective" values.

You're asking us to accept that the deal you offered would be turned
down, and we believe that, not because we appeal to objective values
but becasue we know, or think we know, something about people.

All the people we know exhibit *subjective* values that would lead
them to reject a deal of $1 for all of the land in America.

Great.   Now, so what?

Well, there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
that OTO has been around since at least the late 1800s, long before
Crowley ever heard of it, how long has AMORC been around? (yes, I know
that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory,
but I doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
as a non-profit that can be carbon-dated to 20,000 BC)

I am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behavior

Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow
Catholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice
your faith through good example and decent living and respect
for the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the
level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think
that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,
insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.

The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? 
Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, 
on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From
this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with
Catholic doctrine.

Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love
story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not
exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays
proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic
enough to have a place on a.s.s.

I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also
most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.

I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and
increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of
the "I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face"
stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the
signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.

Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write 
decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead of

The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming

we know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh 
as a reminder. 

Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those
protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don't 
have a good idea yet what "being shielded by the seals" actually involves 
or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the
marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical
well versed.)

Me personally, I'm totally 100% dependent on God through Christ, so 
if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants
to save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way. Being born in
the Spirit, means being part of the Body of Christ (Ephesians 2), so
who and what I was, matters little. * What's important is loving GOD *

Maybe Koresh is right, maybe he isn't, and it should be interesting to

studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re-
warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which 
is not yet clear. 

Much much more important is "Charity" -- which by definition *is* --

I regard love as no more or less "benign" than any other Christian does.
You are merely expressing "approval" of the consequences I find therein.
Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
(or any) religion.  "Love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians
can write both the "gentle" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in
a passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and the
words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, "Love is the unfamiliar Name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..."

This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise
in my note, as will become more evident below.

>As a non-believer, I find Michael's Christianity kinder and gentler.

blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,
given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of "sin" on
another, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", Russel Turpin
and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of Christian love.

>If I take him at
>his word, he cannot condemn the Inquisitors, because they were
>also following these commandments as *they* understood them.  If

You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of
accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "God"
in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:

The "possibility that always exists" is that I (or, to revert to proper
time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could
persuade "Christian B" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note
that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian
argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]
prohibitions.

What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:

	A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
	    in the Inquisition.

	B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however
	    painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their
	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or
	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example
	    "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.)

	A.  I point out that this "justification" of a failure in love
	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.

	B.  Burns me at the stake.

My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is
going on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage."  In this case,
the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial
practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least
greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between A and B.

Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,
then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-
ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense
attorney.  So, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail in
may others.  At the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when it
properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the
Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that
many of the victims of Inquisition will have "accepted" that they were in
fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them.)

The point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do NOT
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main
thrust of the Inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break down
in precisely the "worst" cases.  The "conservative" (I don't think that
is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,
that he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to
a "greater good."  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow
the gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast aside
Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).

I am a "radical" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.

>(Or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow
>man?) And what is the "right thing"?  And how does one go about
>loving god? 

Well, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is that
they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great
Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were
God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A
demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping
up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important
that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  "Conservatives"
may twist this "act as if you were God" to mean "lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules."
They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a
lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy
IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation "against
God" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the "conservatives" have
confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other
people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard
American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.

>Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo
>up front, much of which sounds pretty much the same, but by the
>*specific* acts, procedures, and arguments that they recommend.

And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged
*different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,
it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular
(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.
It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very
little, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little that
the "Christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" for
them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))
for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus
specifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another."

	[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson
	 that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that
	 SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll
	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why
	 there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.]

You are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethical
system.

But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It
may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems
-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.

I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads
of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?
[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th
century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]

Koresh was a nut, okay?  Just because he found ways for the Bible
to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook.

I'll type this very slowly so that you can understand.  He either set
the fire himself or told his followers to do so.  Don't make him out to
be a martyr.  He did not "get killed", he killed himself.

And I maintain:

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by
their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the
darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,
after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes.

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.

Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be
a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
long hike, but it's well worth it!

Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much

Don't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness

When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead
of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity

Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.

You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or
Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how
can you say you have an open mind?

>Sin is fun!  Let's

Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
good life.

I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in
which case it's not really all that important.

Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about
who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me
and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you're right.

Another dodge.  Oh well.  I'm no match for your amazing repertoire
of red herrings and smoke screens.  

You asked for an apology.  I'm not going to apologize for pointing out
that your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  Nor for saying
that your list of "bible contradictions" shows such low standards of
scholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,
just as Josh McDowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  Nor
for objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  Nor
for pointing out that "they do it too" is not an excuse. Nor for calling
your red herrings and smoke screens what they are.

I'm still not sure why you think I'm a hypocrite.  It's true that I
haven't responded to any of Robert Weiss' articles, which may be due in
part to the fact that I almost never read his articles.  But I have
responded to both you and Frank DeCenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  Both
you and Frank have taken quotes out of context, and I've objected to
both of you doing so.  I've criticized bad arguments both when they
were yours and I agreed with the conclusion (that the Bible is not
inerrant), and when they were Frank's and I disagreed with the
conclusion.  I've criticized both you and Frank for evading questions,
and for trying to "explain me away" without addressing the objections
I raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, Frank
by accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the Bible.) I
don't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do I apologize for it.

I do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.

Happy now?

I appreciate the narrow-mindedness of the view expressed in
the text you quoted.  I also appreciate your being amused
by such determined ignorance.  Without taking anything away
from your mirth, I want to say that these views sadden me.

die with the generations that have promoted it.  Teach 
your children well.

Love to,but I must do it a bit later My copy of Harrison in packed, but the
last chapter as best as I can rember deals with Orphic mysteries and their
views of women though she does not come out and say it it is strongly
implyed that the Christian view was drawn heavly from the Orphic and other
Major cults of the time.

Mr. Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco
should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so.
Now, I began scratching my head thinking (a bad sign :-), "don't the 
mainstream religions (in this case Christianity...or the 7th day 
adventist in particular) just keep these guys going ? Isn't Mr. Clinton 
condemning his own religion ? After all, isn't it a cult too ?"

   I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy
meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is
indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word "create"
is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.

  I should have said "given the Mormon belief."  If you disagree with the
Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally
existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important
point.

  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by
such terms.

   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they
believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and
Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or
organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being "offspring" of
God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually "born again" of
Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is
how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a
word is dangerous.

   On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those
who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say
that one must simply "look at the Bible" to see what it teaches, but centuries
of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.
Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the
scriptures?

  Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief
that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We
keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of
Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)

  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon
canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*
importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate
general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large
number of Mormons.

I addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post
by Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday.  The first was made into the
title post of a new thread, "Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?"
and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread

"A Chaney Post, and a Challenge, reissued and revised"

both only in talk.abortion, but I am posting its contents into
talk.religion.misc as soon as I exit here.

This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so.  The
second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us.
The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as 
KaflowitzDebatingPoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both
talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to 
talk.abortion alone.  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that
he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow
talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not
also setting his Newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.

Christians.

Christians through ages have had to learn to be patient. I do think
it's time to face the reality. The events during the last 52 two

Jesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the

organized religion.

I share Dennis's outrage over a similar manner.  I have recently become aware
that my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries
suffered by Christians.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums
may be used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is divine
punishment for their sinful conduct.  In addition these folks are able to
avail themselves of such alternative therapies as Lourdes, Fatima,
Morris Cerullo, Benny Hinn, etc.  In any case as "Jesus Saves' I feel
that there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my
expense.  I would like to request that I be exempted from Christian
coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.

John 12:24-26: "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat
falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it
produces much grain.
  "He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in
this world will keep it for eternal life.
  "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My
servant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor."

Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?

If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to
enjoy what he has given us?

Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I
will die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have
before that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be
content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too
are dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.

In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically
mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and
fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no
matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.

If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be
it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants

Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was
Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or
Norse legend, if memory serves.

But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?

If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --
provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind
faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.

You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting
Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that
will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never
demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he
just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of
common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.

But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the
verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,
which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only
he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all
strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with
that: substitute "Moslem" or "Buddhist" or "Satanist" instead of
"Christian", and it means the same thing.

Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if
you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,
you've got some convincing to do.

And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities
where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding
and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to
yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start
waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.

The Nicene Creed

WE BELIEVE in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.  He suffered and was buried, and the third day rose again according to the Scriptur





es, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father.  And he shall come again with glory to judge  both the quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end.

And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets.  And we believe in one holy and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. And we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

  Unfortunately, it's not that simple.  The KJV is preferred by the majority
of fundamentalists (at least here).  The second part of your argument fails
as well, since that statement can be used against any version (not just the

  I would not find this statement to be very useful since it is an appeal
to authority and the opposition will just claim that their authorities are
"better".  A second tact that local creationists have used is to reply "but
those scholars are atheists and cannot be believed" (they will also use this
phrase to describe any theologians that they don't agree with).

  The verse being discussed clearly claims that sympathetic magic works (i.e.
placing stripped sticks in the cattle breeding grounds causes stripped and
spotted calves to be born) and should be attacked on that basis (no biologist
has ever observed this claimed correlation).

It is true that Mormons believe that all spirits (including Jesus,
Lucifer, Robert Weiss) are in the same family.  It does not mean
that Jesus was created, but rather that Lucifer and Robert Weiss
were not.  I agree that this is a "heresy".  So what?  
The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is
not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement
in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.  
As far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is Biblical,
and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against
the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative
ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.
I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't
know what you mean by "That He needed to be saved".  Jesus?
Jehovah?  Elohim?  In Mormon doctrine, Jesus was sinless,
and thus did not "need to be saved".

In two places at once? Bit of a coincidence, that.

Whatever the faults the FBI had, the fact is that responsibility
for those deaths lies with Koresh.

  Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is
probably the weakest evidence.

  What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out
by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of
detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used
today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the
existance of Jesus, only of his activities.

  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the
gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a
source).

How incredibly fucking stupid.  Of *course* the text is referring to the city
itself (buildings, bricks, mortar, etc.)  Otherwise it makes no sense to
refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a _place_ to spread 
fishing nets.

Is there any twisting of text or semantic game that you *won't* do to preserve 
your faith from admission of error, DeCenso?

Surely you are not equating David Koresh with Christianity? The two are

By "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when
Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most of
which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.
I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove
that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities."
Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like it
could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral
standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it
appears, those of David Koresh.

#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram
#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over
#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like
#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider
#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make
#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The

And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral
aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have
nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only "crime"
was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried
to explain the "Smith phenomenon" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5
million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's
testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.

#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed
#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only
#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have
#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The
#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help
#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.
#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited
#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other
#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)

"The rest" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,
while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various
auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new
prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and
doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in
line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior
apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated
that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.

Other rightful "heirs" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated
(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,
Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty
land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This
"Rekhabite" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated
by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.

Granted, a couple of "do-it-yourselfers" stayed behind, unwilling to
sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but
this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The
church benefitted from this purification process: they became even
more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.

#        Both sects practiced the "1-year food stockpile" doctrine,

#
#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.

BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of
the largest denominations in the country) a "sect"???  It didn't "splinter"
from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.

What a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am
not comfortable with this alleged "cosiness" with Mammon: I assure you
that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our
ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has
appointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about
suicide and "atone for sins with blood") is yet another insulting
misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I
am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes
of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the
first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith
STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all
people are free to worship "*how*, *where*, or *what* they may."

#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS
#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his
#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may
#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You
#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected

#These people are the "salt of the Earth" and as such are more

A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people
are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's "orders" (the late
president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong
opposition of the selection of the MX "Peace Keeper" missile maze
in Utah).

Unfortunately, I think you've got it figured pretty well.  I also ask
myself the question "Why did they plan for so many months.  Why was
this so important to them?  What was the government really up to?
Why did they seal the warrant?  Were they after Koresh or were they after      
the first and second amendments, among others?

I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my
own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some 
references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where 
Lane Fox writes, "... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' 
career] is agreed to be a Christian addition."

In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21
April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine 
Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  "A comment *attributed* to
Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention
the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.

So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: 
1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the
long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. 
I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are
orginally developed (does anyone?).

Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The
former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and
ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I 
didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to
incorporate theology).

Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before 
Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one 
hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,
because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is 
certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have 
the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic 
ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.

On religion:

"Oh, where is the sea?", the fishes cried,
As they swam its clearness through.





There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied
that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of
people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.

This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used
differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes
happens that someone says "My grandson is the cutest baby!" and then turns
around and sees the granddaughter and says "Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?"

This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the
world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for
first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very
object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,
nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is
often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly
literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,
it is not.


Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from
John E King:

> The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the
> area[.]

No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from
Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say
"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff
like that."  You would read "I will make you a bare rock" and "You will never
be rebuilt", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way
to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large
population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.

In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the
prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal
reading, they could read this passage and conclude "medium-size city".

You seem to feel that "Never be rebuilt" means "be rebuilt" -- maybe so, but
it is hardly a `clear implication'.


Mr King also writes:

> So far I've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000.
> Let's assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards
> we are talking about a one-horse town.

Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm
from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington
resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but
it's at least a two-horse town.

But supposing 22,000 people is a "small town" -- it's still 22,000 people
MORE than Ezekiel predicted.


And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel
predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their
valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29
Ezekiel even quotes God as saying "he and his army got no reward from the
campaign he led against Tyre."

Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.
Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says
that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.

Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before
the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.

 *

This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability
to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.

For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26
by pulling some "clear implications" out of hat.

When Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your towers", that clearly implied
that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers
used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would "demolish your fine houses
and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea", that clearly implied
that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.
would "build a ramp up to your walls", that clearly implies that N. would
spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the
walls.

See?  A few "clear implications" that are totally contrary to the text, and
you can reconcile anything you want.

OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:

Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes
sense.  Matt 5:17 "Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or
the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill."  Jesus lived
under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises
of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey
God's purposes.

Verse 18 says "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass
away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,
until all is accomplished."  The key to this verse IMHO is the last 
phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, "accomplished" what the 
Law was supposed to accomplish.  

Verse 19:  "Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,
and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven."  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish 
people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.

In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about "doing away with the Law."  That was not 
Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his 
people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your 
heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be "doing 
away with the Law" because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only 
God's Law.

In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law 
and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon 
on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people 
understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.

In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the 
Law in this way:

[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore 
the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be 
justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no 
longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith 
in Christ Jesus.

I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had 
served it's purpose, i.e. "our tutor to lead us to Christ," and
now, "we are no longer under a tutor."  The law has been "fulfilled" 
as Christ said he would do.

God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same
personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the "last
will and testament" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. 
It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are
re-expressed in Christianity. 

On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and 
Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the "mysteries" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism 
representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),
The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and
Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,
Acts 20:7)

OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome
other Christians to offer other alternatives.

Please excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read

Since this drivel is also crossposted to alt.atheism, how about reading

Is there any difference in saying 

"Absolute Truth exists, but some people think its a lie"

and

"Truth is relative" ?

I think there is:  in both examples, the first statement is a
fundamental disagreement between at least two people; the 
second statement is agreed upon by all.

To put it another way, someone who says objective values exist
does not agree that values are subjective.

Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use
the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this
religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important
historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become 
common.

The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional
morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's
accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.

For example,

Story of Adam and Eve:
Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited
supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says
not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide 
in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.
(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in
the bushes that might have angered God.)

Traditional Philosophy:
1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will
provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This
is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.
2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler 
and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without 
question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.

Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:
They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God
told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were
obligated to do whatever their "Father" said to.  Being forced to leave the 
Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.

Lessons from Traditional Interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is ideal.  Get-
ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.
3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.
4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and 
should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for 
themselves.
5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from
learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.

1990's philosophy:
1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless
named "Hillary Clinton" or "Murphy Brown".
2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people 
(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.

Interpretation of events based on current philosophy:
They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge
rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge
and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-
selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were 
REWARDED by being allowed into the "real world."

Lessons from new interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read "welfare") is at best
a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn
is ideal.
3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.
4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and
should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and "alter
or abolish" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.
5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge
but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children 
without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better
life for their children (and themselves).

I have tentatively named this new philosophy "The Church of Eveism" because
Eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead
of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly
a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek 
knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the
decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention
and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it 
until it was actively sought.

Sorry, the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called A.M.O.R.C, 
I don't remember for the time being what the A.M. stand for
but O.R.C is Ordo Rosae Crucis, in other words latin for
Order of the Rose Cross. Sigh, seems l'm loosing more and more
of my long term memory.

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent
metaphysical bookstore, if any of you are interested in such books.
And my son loves to run around in their Egyptian museum.

Cheers,
Kent

Be sure we pick on the "correct groups" here.  "Bible thumpers",
"fundamentalists", and Southern Baptists *deserve* our hasty generalizations
and prejudicial statements.  Just don't pick on the Presbyterians
and the Methodists!

I'll defer to your greater firsthand knowledge in such matters.

Jim, please, that's a lame explanation of the trinity that Jesus provides
above. Baptizing people in the name of three things != trinity. If
this is the case, then I'm wrong, I assumed that trinity implies that
God is three entities, and yet the same.
